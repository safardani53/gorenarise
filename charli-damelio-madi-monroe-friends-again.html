Soon, there was drama between the two, and they stopped being friends and contacting each other.</p><p>Moreover, they unfollowed each other on Instagram as well and stopped talking about each other. This made it seem like the beef between the two was deep.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>But now, it looks like Charli is friends with Monroe once again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is the beef between Charlie D’Amelio and Madi Monroe over?</h2><p>Monroe was born on January 27, 2004, making her age 19 years as of 2023. Many people wished her on her birthday this year.</p><p>Monroe was posting pictures on her social media and sharing the wishes she got on her birthday. The one that caught fans and followers by surprise was the birthday wishes and flowers sent by the D’Amelio family.</p><p>The D’Amelio family sent Monroe a bouquet of red roses and flowers on her 19th birthday with a card that said “Happy Birthday Madi,” signed by the entire family.</p><p>Monroe posted the photo on her stories and wrote “Thank you guys” with heart and kiss emojis. Additionally, she tagged Marc D’Amelio, Heidi D’Amelio, <a href=#>Dixie D’Amelio</a>, and Charli on the stories.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Madi-Monroe-friends-Charli-DAmelio.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Madi Monroe’s Instagram Story hints at her squashing beef with Charli D’Amelio. (Source: Madi Monroe’s Instagram Story)</p><p>The story was soon reposted by Charli’s sister, Dixie, and their mother, Heidi, on their Instagram stories. Soon, Monroe followed Charli on the platform, and the latter did the same.</p><p>This led many to believe that the two had restored their friendship and were happy for the two. However, some fans believe Charli did not personally send the followers to Monroe.</p><p>Heidi is close friends with Monroe’s mother, Erika. In fact, Erika shared her birthday with her daughter, and Heidi posted various IG Stories wishing Erika.</p><p>So, people have speculated that Heidi sent the flowers to Monroe and added the entire family’s name on the card. Regardless, both Monroe and Charli have started to follow each other, which hints at them squashing their beef to some extent.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was the drama between Charli D’Amelio and Madi Monroe?</h2><p>After Monroe deleted her Instagram and TikTok accounts in late 2021, several irrational allegations started to spread. Later, she reactivated her social media accounts and dispelled allegations about her and her close friend, Charli.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress’s temporary deactivation started when she wrote an odd statement on Twitter. Many fans believed Monroe and Charli had something to do with the entire situation.</p><p>Monroe also uploaded a video of crying, which fanned the flames. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Life</a>, Monroe talked about her first encounter with Charli in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p>She said Charli was hanging out with <a href=#>Chase Hudson</a>, a.k.a. LilHuddy, at her house by calling Hudson, who is her best buddy. Later, Hudson and Charli would start dating.</p><p>Monroe claimed that she and Charli did not talk, but as they followed one another on social media, their chats and DMs aided the development of their friendship.</p><p>Regarding her relationship with Charli, Monroe was quoted as stating, “everyone is constantly judging us. But, when we’re together, we’re very powerful. We really do truly love each other so much. And we are really best friends.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Monroe, as previously reported, withdrew from her social engagements after informing the world that she was in distress. “So which one of my friends is gonna finally realize I’m rly [really] not okay LOL,” she tweeted.&nbsp;</p><p>In a subsequent tweet, Monroe responded with, “[expletive] up too.” She returned to social media after realizing the mess she had made.&nbsp;</p><p>In a TikTok video, she explained that her post was about “me erasing everything of me and my ex.”</p><p>Monroe also confirmed her friendship status with Charli and said, “Me and Charli are good.” However, it seems that was when the drama between the two started.</p><p>After Monroe posted — and quickly deleted — a questionable comment in early 2022, fans were sure that TikTok stars were fighting. They questioned her friendship with Charli after she tweeted about TikToker’s low-key relationship with Hudson.</p><p>“Lol, you’re so fake,” Monroe wrote. “ You cried to me about him but kissed him on New Year’s.” She quickly deleted the message, but fans saw Hudson had unfollowed Monroe on Instagram before Monroe could reply to the developing rumor.</p><p>Monore quickly took to Instagram to clarify that her controversial post was about another of her pals. She noted that she had other friends than Charli and Hudson,</p><p>She said, “My tweet last night was about my friend Sophia and her boyfriend. We were beefing, but we good now… you do realize I have a whole other circle of friends right?”</p><p>However, Monroe and D’Amelio have not been seen together since that day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8KhmKukmWKxornEpaCoZZ2Wsap5zKilq6eVYrOztcSnm6xlkZyuqrqO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html&text=Charli%20D%27Amelio%20Sent%20Flowers%20To%20Madi%20Monroe%20On%20Her%20Birthday&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html&title=Charli%20D%27Amelio%20Sent%20Flowers%20To%20Madi%20Monroe%20On%20Her%20Birthday" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html&title=Charli%20D%27Amelio%20Sent%20Flowers%20To%20Madi%20Monroe%20On%20Her%20Birthday" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html&title=Charli%20D%27Amelio%20Sent%20Flowers%20To%20Madi%20Monroe%20On%20Her%20Birthday" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html&description=Charli%20D%27Amelio%20Sent%20Flowers%20To%20Madi%20Monroe%20On%20Her%20Birthday" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./archie-madekwe-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Family, Dating History &amp;amp; Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bury and Bolton EFL exit  League One relegation and League Two promotion explained as Wanderers S">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
