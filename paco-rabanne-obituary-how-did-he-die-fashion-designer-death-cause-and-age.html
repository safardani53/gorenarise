He was a fashion designer of French and Spanish origin who came to fame in the 1960s. Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo, better known as Paco Rabanne, was a French-Spanish fashion designer who came to popularity as an enfant terrible in the 1960s French fashion scene. He started his career in fashion by designing jewelry for Givenchy, Dior, and Balenciaga. Rabanne founded his own fashion business in 1966. He used odd materials such as metal, paper, and plastic to create spectacular and flamboyant creations. To commemorate the beginning of his collection, he presented “Manifesto: 12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials” in 1966.</p><p>Jane Fonda donned a green dress created by Rabanne in the 1968 science fiction film Barbarella. Paco Rabanne was a favorite designer of Françoise Hardy. Singer Mylène Farmer commissioned Rabanne to design her stage costumes for her 1996 Tour and the accompanying Live à Bercy record. Let us go further to learn more about Paco Rabanne’s demise.</p><h2>Paco Rabanne’s Death And Obituary: What Happened To The Spanish Fashion Designer?</h2><p>On Friday, the company that controls Paco Rabanne’s fashion business announced on its website that the Spanish-born designer, best known for his globally marketed fragrances and metallic, space-age garments, had died.&nbsp;“The House of Paco Rabanne would like to pay tribute to our founder and creative genius, Paco Rabanne, who died today at the age of 88.” According to Puig, his legacy will live on, making him one of the most influential people in twentieth-century fashion.</p><p>Rabanne’s newest ready-to-wear designs will be shown during Paris Fashion Week, which runs from February 27 to March 3. He has several visionary traits. Paco Rabanne died on Friday, February 3, at the age of 88, leaving behind the memories of a man who created his own unmistakable stamp on fashion history.&nbsp;His name was mostly connected with scent hits that were both catastrophic and unrealistic around the turn of the century.&nbsp;However, his bold material choices, imaginative use of those materials, visionary attitude, and creative freedom have influenced a new generation of fashion designers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paco-Rabanne-1.jpg alt="Paco Rabanne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Paco Rabanne’s Childhood and Education</h2><p>Rabanne was born on February 18, 1934, in the Basque town of Pasaia, Gipuzkoa. His father, a Republican Colonel, was executed by Francoist soldiers during the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;When Cristóbal Balenciaga started Balenciaga in Paris in 1937, he evacuated Rabanne’s family due to the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;Rabanne’s mother was the chief seamstress at Balenciaga’s first couture House, which was located in Donostia, Basque Country.</p><p>Rabanne worked as a fashion sketcher for Dior and Givenchy and a shoe sketcher for Charles Jourdan while studying architecture at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris in the mid-1950s.&nbsp;Rabanne subsequently went to work with Auguste Perret, France’s premier maker of reinforced concrete, where he stayed for almost 10 years.</p><h2>Additional Information about Paco Rabanne</h2><p>Rabanne visited Kiev, Ukraine, in 2006. “Ukraine reminds me of a flower opening its petals before my eyes,” he added, describing the developments since the Orange Revolution. Lydia Maurer, a German-Colombian fashion designer, succeeded Arora as chief designer in the summer of 2012. Julien Dossena, a Belgian-born former Balenciaga designer, was appointed Paco Rabanne’s creative director of womenswear in the middle of 2013.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paco-Rabanne-2.jpg alt="Paco Rabanne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following that, fashion critics praised Dossena’s designs. The ateliers are located on Avenue Montaigne in Paris, above Nina Ricci, a flagship shop of another Puig fashion company. Following the closing of the last Paco Rabanne stores more than 10 years before, a new store eventually opened in January 2016 on Rue Cambon in Paris.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmpufYr%2BirsCnpZ5ln5e2tcHAq7BmoJ%2BseqW1w2afnmWUnrJussCsn6KnnmKxpr%2FIoKWeql2ZsqLAx2aamq2jmnqiusNmmKCdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html&text=Paco%20Rabanne%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Fashion%20Designer%20Death%20Cause%20And%20Age&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html&title=Paco%20Rabanne%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Fashion%20Designer%20Death%20Cause%20And%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html&title=Paco%20Rabanne%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Fashion%20Designer%20Death%20Cause%20And%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html&title=Paco%20Rabanne%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Fashion%20Designer%20Death%20Cause%20And%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaco-rabanne-obituary-how-did-he-die-fashion-designer-death-cause-and-age.html&description=Paco%20Rabanne%20Obituary%3a%20How%20Did%20He%20Die%3f%20Fashion%20Designer%20Death%20Cause%20And%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whg3wtcl8lpxqrmc0omt80per5gotzhj.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Wonder Pets Season 2 Episode 1: Save the Beetles!/3 Wonder Pets and a Baby!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jared-leto-covers-candy-in-drag.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jared Leto Covers Candy... in Drag!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
