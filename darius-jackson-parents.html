He can also be seen on KeyTV's Sportsfan, a scripted series, co-created by Keke and Darius.</p><p>"Co-creating and writing Sportsfan was a truly exciting experience for me. Pushing the boundaries of traditional storytelling by filming the entire series on a smartphone allowed for a level of creativity and innovation that I believe sets the series apart...” Keke said in a statement. “My co-creator Darius and I pulled from our real-life situations, whether it be Lila planning a baby shower in the middle of football season or CJ dealing with different family dynamics – to make a series that felt relevant, familiar, and honestly fun for the KeyTV viewers!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Darius and Keke began dating in 2021 after meeting during a party at Diddy's house.</h2><p>(Yes, that Diddy).

See you soon."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Darius's brother, Sarunas,</a> and Keke's mom, Sharon Palmer, engaged in a social media war after the news broke about Keke's restraining order. In a since-deleted tweet, Sarunas claimed Keke's allegations against his brother were false and claimed the actor "abuses almost everyone," while asking his followers to "pray" for Leodis. The comments caused Sharon to clap back on her Instagram, stating Sarunas is "the biggest f-boy in hollywood" and knew about the alleged abuse between his brother and her daughter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Keke's abuse allegations come just months after she and Darius raised suspicions that they were no longer together. In July 2023, the couple were at odds after Keke attended Usher's concert wearing a curve-hugging sheer outfit. Darius took to Twitter to publicly critique Keke's outfit choice, suggesting his girlfriend at the time should've covered up.</p><p>“It’s the outfit tho... you a mom,” he reportedly said, also tweeting, "We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife and mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others.
