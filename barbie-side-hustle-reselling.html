to this day, she's bought over 5,000.</p><p>When <a href=#>Covid-19 </a>hit, the lockdown gave her even more time to grow her business.</p><p>While doing school at home, Adrianna was able to continue to buy and sell Barbies and grow her business.</p><p>She has shipped dolls to all parts of the world, including <a href=#>Germany</a>, <a href=#>Mexico </a>and even <a href=#>Australia</a>.</p><p>There have been a ton of new customers, and some of them have told her that she's the reason they decided to start collecting.</p><p>Adrianna was even able to snag one of the rarest dolls, the Happy Family pregnant Midge.</p><p>These are <a href=#>listed online</a> for upwards of $160.</p><p>She didn't know she had bought one until she opened the box and started going through the dolls.</p><p>The collector had unfortunately passed away, and her family was selling the entire collection to help cover funeral costs.</p><p>Adrianna got way more than she bargained for when she found the rare, discontinued doll in the box.</p><p>She hadn't even listed it before fans started sending her offers.</p><p>"I almost fell over, I didn't really know what I was getting in the box until I opened it," she said.</p><p>In 2002, the doll was introduced with a magnetic abdomen that can be removed to show a small baby hidden beneath.</p><p>Parents <a href=# aria-label="were less than thrilled about it (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">were less than thrilled about it</a> - especially since she was packaged alone without any family members - and it was quickly pulled from shelves.</p><p>"I had never seen one in person before. This is like the one Barbie everyone wants, it's like the Holy Grail."</p><h2>BARBIE MONEY</h2><p>Adrianna sells most of her dolls for $20 to $25, but there are limited edition ones that go for hundreds.</p><p>In her first year, she spent about $30,000 and made it all back. Most of that money went back into the business.</p><p>By keeping her stock high and regularly posting, she's brought in $45,000 in sales.</p><p>"It just makes me feel good to know one day I'm going to be very, very successful," she said.</p><p>"Since I was 14, I've always said I want to be a millionaire by 20 ... I push myself every day to make it happen."</p><p>It's important to note that with extra income and side hustles come extra <a href=#>taxes and responsibilities</a>.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>Form 1040</a>&nbsp;is required for those with multiple sources of income, as you have to list all your income on a single form.</p><p>In addition, you'll need to file a Schedule C and a Form SE to report your self-employment taxes.</p><p>There are several other people who do the same thing as Adrianna with all different types of products.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>See how another woman makes up to <a href=#>$20,000 a month</a> by reselling vintage clothing.</p><p>Plus, another reseller <a href=#>literally sold a trashcan for $300</a> - see what makes it so valuable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbH52hZBqbmiakaevqrGMrKCdnV2dwrTAy55kq52jmrmttc2gZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html&text=I%20became%20a%20%27Barbie%20broker%27%20at%2016%20working%20out%20of%20my%20shed%20-%20now%20I%20make%20up%20to%20%243%2c500%20a%20month%20while%20in%20s&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html&title=I%20became%20a%20%27Barbie%20broker%27%20at%2016%20working%20out%20of%20my%20shed%20-%20now%20I%20make%20up%20to%20%243%2c500%20a%20month%20while%20in%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html&title=I%20became%20a%20%27Barbie%20broker%27%20at%2016%20working%20out%20of%20my%20shed%20-%20now%20I%20make%20up%20to%20%243%2c500%20a%20month%20while%20in%20s" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html&title=I%20became%20a%20%27Barbie%20broker%27%20at%2016%20working%20out%20of%20my%20shed%20-%20now%20I%20make%20up%20to%20%243%2c500%20a%20month%20while%20in%20s" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbarbie-side-hustle-reselling.html&description=I%20became%20a%20%27Barbie%20broker%27%20at%2016%20working%20out%20of%20my%20shed%20-%20now%20I%20make%20up%20to%20%243%2c500%20a%20month%20while%20in%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nelson-gonzalez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nelson Gonzalez">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./connor-brashiers-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Connor Brashiers Girlfriend: Who is Connor Brashier Dating?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
