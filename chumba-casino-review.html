Social casinos let you play casino-style games online, totally free.</strong></p><p>The games can‚Äôt be played for real money even if you wanted to, meaning social casinos are legally available even in most US states. Still, when you play in promotional mode, you can walk away with cash prizes.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center>üéÅ <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Sign up at Chumba Casino and get 2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</a></strong> üéÅ</p><p>In this Chumba Casino review, we‚Äôre going deep into everything you need to know about one of the top social casinos in the country. We explain exactly how it works, how you can purchase coins and redeem cash prizes, the games, customer support, the legal stuff, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything you need to know about Chumba Casino is here.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pros and cons of Chumba Casino&nbsp;</h2><p>During our Chumba Casino review, we found lots of things to like and some areas we think could be improved too. Below, you can see our main takeaways.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Over 150 games in total</li><li>Good variety of games outside of slots</li><li>Excellent bingo options</li><li>Good range of payment methods supported</li><li>Daily bonus featuring both GCs and SCs</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>You need a minimum of 100 Sweeps Coins to redeem a cash prize&nbsp;</li><li>No live chat support</li><li>No live games</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üí∞ Chumba Casino bonuses and promotions</h2><p>Like all social casinos, bonuses, and promotions are a big part of Chumba Casino‚Äôs appeal and brand strategy. All the games at Chumba are available to play for free using different types of coins, which can be claimed via lots of different promos and giveaways.&nbsp;</p><p>In this section, we‚Äôre running through the main bonuses to look out for at <strong><a href=# aria-label="Chumba Casino (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Chumba Casino</a></strong>. In addition to the below, we strongly recommend following Chumba on different social media sites - where you can often find exclusive offers and giveaways.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chumba Casino welcome bonus</h3><p>First up, right off the bat, as soon as you create your account, Chumba will provide you with <a aria-label="2,000,000 Gold Coins and 2 Sweeps Coins totally free (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">2,000,000 Gold Coins and 2 Sweeps Coins totally free</a>. It‚Äôs a great offer and means you can start playing in either standard mode or promotional immediately, without jumping through hoops or making any extra purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2 million GC amount is particularly generous: it means you realistically may never run out of your free supply if you have no interest in topping up your account by purchasing additional coins.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Chumba Casino welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/thesun-chumba-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

For your first purchase, you can get 10,000,000 GCs along with 30 free SCs for just $10. The regular price for this purchase is $30, and this is a one-time-only offer as a <a aria-label="bonus for signing up with Chumba Casino (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bonus for signing up with Chumba Casino</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, while you can get free GCs and SCs in lots of ways, Chumba also gives you the option of purchasing additional Gold Coins whenever you want. When you do, you may often receive free Sweeps Coins as a bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>Head to the store section that you can navigate to by clicking on the "Get Coins" button located on the top right to see the different Gold Coin package options, along with the free Sweeps Coins you can pick up if you decide to make a purchase.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Chumba Casino purchase offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/thesun-chumba-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Find the Gold Coin bundle and play at Chumba Casino!</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

However, there are lots of benefits for regular players.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, every single day you log in you‚Äôll be given a bonus of 200,000 GC and 1 SC. All you need to do to claim this offer is wait 24 hours after your last bonus. As soon as you log in, a window will pop up inviting you to claim your free coins.&nbsp;</p><p>Chumba also regularly hands out free coins and other bonuses via promotional email and to players who engage with their accounts on social media. With social casinos, the clue is in the name: the more you get involved with the community, the more benefits you find yourself getting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìã How to register at Chumba Casino</h2><p><a href=# aria-label="Signing up at Chumba (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Signing up at Chumba</a> is an absolute breeze. Click the purple ‚ÄúCreate Account‚Äù button to get started, and you can begin filling in your details. Social casinos often don‚Äôt require quite the same level of detail as real money casinos from their players to sign up, but they are legally required to verify the identity of anyone who plays in sweepstakes mode.&nbsp;</p><p>You can choose whether to sign up via your existing Facebook account (if you have one), or manually sign up using an email address. In the latter case, all you need is the following:</p><ul><li>Full Name</li><li>Email Address</li><li>Password</li></ul><p>That‚Äôs enough to get your account up and running, with 2,000,000 GCs and 2 SCs waiting for you. Remember, you need to be at least 18 years old to create an account with Chumba.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Chumba Casino welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/thesun-chumba-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

In fact, many social sites support coin purchases with bank cards only, so it‚Äôs nice to see that Chumba has some variety.</p><p>You can purchase Gold Coins at <strong><a href=# aria-label="Chumba Casino (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Chumba Casino</a></strong> using the following methods:</p><ul><li>Bank Cards (Visa / Matercard)</li><li>Prepaid Cards (paysafecard)</li><li>ACH Transfer / Online Banking</li><li>Skrill</li></ul><p>The process for each method is very straightforward. No matter which you choose, it only takes a couple of clicks to complete a coin purchase.</p><p>It‚Äôs worth remembering that if you are going to request a cash prize redemption down the line, it will need to be transferred to a bank account in the same name as your Chumba account or the bank card you used.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üéÅ How to redeem cash prizes at Chumba Casino&nbsp;</h2><p>Before we jump into prize redemptions, we need to be clear on how the games and coins work at Chumba Casino.</p><p>Every game can be played in either Gold Coins mode or Sweepstakes Mode, and you can get free Gold Coins and Sweepstakes Coins in lots of different ways - as we‚Äôve covered already.&nbsp;</p><p>The main difference between the two coins is that Sweeps Coins can never be purchased. It may often be rewarded as part of a free bonus or when purchasing Gold Coins.</p><p>No matter how many GCs you win you can never withdraw them, redeem them for prizes or use them for anything else outside of Chumba Casino.</p><p>Sweeps Coins are a little different: when you win more SCs through playing games, they can be redeemed for prizes - either gift cards or cash prizes.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>üëâ <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Sign up at Chumba Casino and get 2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</a></strong> ‚≠ê</p><p>There are a couple of restrictions on redeeming SCs. The first is that you can‚Äôt redeem any Sweeps Coins you received as part of a bonus without first using them to play the games. &nbsp;</p><p>The other is that you need to hit certain thresholds to request a redemption. You need at least 50 SCs to request a gift card, which gets sent to your email address. You need at least 100 SCs to request a cash prize redemption, which gets transferred to your bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you need to fully verify your identity before your redemption can be processed. This involves sending Chumba a copy of your ID, which corresponds to the personal info you used to sign up.&nbsp;</p><p>As long as you fulfil these requirements, the process for redeeming Sweeps Coins is very straightforward. Simply choose the redemption option in the menu and follow the instructions. All in all the process can take a little time, especially when you first have to verify your identity. Allow up to 7 days for everything to be sorted.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Chumba Casino welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/thesun-chumba-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

Some of the more basic social casinos tend to simply stick to one or two types of slots at most - not the case at Chumba Casino.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center>üé∞ <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener" href=#>Get 2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC at Chumba and play slots</a></strong> üé∞</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chumba Bingo</h3><p>Experience the thrill of winning huge prizes with Chumba Casino's exciting range of bingo games!

Please play responsibly.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chumba Casino table games</h3><p>There is also a solid selection of table games on the menu at Chumba. You can play various different types of blackjack and roulette, as well as video poker. It‚Äôs a nice change of pace from the slots.&nbsp;</p><p>Bingo and Slingo games are also a specialty at Chumba. Every day you can join 75 Ball and 90 Ball bingo games, as well as the innovative Bingo Blast which condenses the game into a timeframe of under five minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chumba Casino live dealer games</h3><p>It‚Äôs still early days for live dealer games at social casinos, with just a handful of sites beginning to introduce certain live elements to their games. Unfortunately, Chumba is not yet one of them. As live technology becomes more ingrained in social casinos, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see these types of games arrive at Chumba Casino soon.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üì± Chumba Casino mobile app</h2><p>Chumba does not currently have a mobile app, which is a pity. That said, you can easily play using your mobile browser. The site has been optimized for mobile access so that it actually feels quite like an app when you open it, with the games and menus formatted nicely for the smaller screen.</p><p>You‚Äôll get the exact same features and usability on your mobile as you do on the desktop site and we‚Äôre happy with the overall design. That said, it would be nice to see an app created.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chumba Casino loyalty rewards</h2><p>As we‚Äôve touched on already, <strong><a href=# aria-label="Chumba Casino (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Chumba Casino</a></strong> doesn‚Äôt really have a loyalty or rewards program where you earn points the more you play - as is common with real-money online casinos. However, there are tons of incentives to play regularly and stay engaged with Chumba.&nbsp;</p><p>Most significantly, there is a daily login bonus of 200,000 GCs and 1 SC available every 24 hours. Chumba often gives out free coins and publishes other promos on social media and via email to players.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìû Chumba Casino customer support</h2><p>The customer support at Chumba is good but could be improved.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, we‚Äôre happy to say that there is a detailed menu of FAQs explaining exactly how the site works, including the intricacies of Sweeps Coins and the Sweepstakes model. Too many social casinos just plunge into the games without taking the time to help beginners along the way with a well-stocked help section - but not Chumba,</p><p>Our main criticism is the lack of live chat support. If you want to get in contact with support staff you‚Äôll need to create a ticket using the form on the Chumba site. It‚Äôs a relatively slow process and live chat just can‚Äôt be beaten for convenience. We‚Äôd love to see it added.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Chumba Casino welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/thesun-chumba-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>2,000,000 free GC + 2 free SC</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

Chumba Casino has been one of the <a href=#>leading social casinos in the US</a> since the beginning of the craze, and it‚Äôs showing no signs of slowing down. The gaming menu is very impressive: well over a hundred slots but also a healthy selection of table games and bingo too. Some social casinos can feel a little samey in terms of games, but not Chumba.</p><p>We like the range of promos too, including the fact that you get free GCs and SCs every day simply for logging in. Purchasing coins is nice and easy, and we found the redemption process straightforward too - if a little time-consuming.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of improvements, it would be nice to see the 100 minimum SC redemption requirement lowered for cash prizes.
