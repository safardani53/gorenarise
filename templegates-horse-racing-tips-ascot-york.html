It was hard to know what to make of her debut win at Yarmouth in June as there was only four runners and the ground was testing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000499748122-e1564146616119.jpg><p>Any doubts about her ability were blown away on her second start when she destroyed six previous winners to land a Newmarket Listed contest a coupe of weeks later. That six-length success came in the manner of a really smart filly and it will take a very smart horse to stop her today.</p><p><strong>Alpha Centauri</strong> gave Irish trainer Jessica Harrington some great days and she looks to have another decent filly on her hands with<strong> Punita Arora</strong>.</p><p>She stepped up on her promising debut when overcoming a hefty bump at the start to strike over 5f at Navan a couple of weeks ago. Today’s extra furlong is a help for her.</p><p>It was hard not to be impressed with <strong>Ultra Violet</strong>’s debut win. After fluffing the start she was too keen for her own good in the early stages but she showed a monster engine to roar home by eight lengths at Newmarket.</p><p>The form might not be strong but the performance certainly was. My only worry is her inexperience.</p><p>The same remark applies to <strong>So Sharp</strong>. She landed the same Newbury contest as the last two Princess Margaret winners on her debut – when <strong>Dark Lady</strong> was runner-up - but she did get the run of that race.</p><p><strong>2.25</strong></p><p><strong>WINGS OF TIME</strong> looks ready to fly in the Porsche Handicap. He was successful at Wolverhampton in February and he ran a cracker when runner-up behind smart prospect <strong>Cadre Du Noir</strong> at Newmarket on his return from a five-month break.</p><p>That clearly did him the world of good as he returned to the July Course to run out the winner of a good handicap a couple of weeks ago. He drifted to the stands’ side in the closing stages and that might not have been a bad thing given the way the track was riding.</p><p>That doesn’t put me off as I think he’s improving and that makes him dangerous. <strong>Motakhayyel</strong> was another horse to win at Newmarket’s July Meeting.</p><p>Perversely, he was probably helped by racing in the middle of the course as the track bias had changed later in the week. He was certainly in a good prominent position throughout and he might find it tricky to confirm form with the runner-up <strong>Flashcard</strong>.</p><p>Andrew Balding’s hope had little chance in trying to come from off the pace that day. He should get a better pace to aim at today and he is 6lbs better off with Motakhayyel.</p><p><strong>Prince Of Hearts</strong> would like to see a drop of rain but <strong>Beatboxer</strong> would prefer it if the forecast showers failed to materialise.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Hottest in Horse Racing</h2></p><p><strong>3.00</strong></p><p><strong>KAESO</strong> should have the corks popping in the Moet & Chandon International. He’s a remarkable horse who has rapidly risen through the ranks from basement contests to top handicaps.</p><p>If last week’s smooth Doncaster win is anything to go by his progress is nowhere near its end. He was a little unlucky when third - beaten just half-a-length - from an unhelpful draw in the Victoria Cup over track and trip in May. There’s plenty going for Nigel Tinkler’s ace.</p><p>It’s hard to see how <strong>Ripp Orf</strong> won’t run well. He was third in this race 12 months ago having landed the Victoria Cup over this course and distance earlier in the season. He’s yet to strike this year but he has put up solid shows in big-field handicaps and he does tend to show his best form at Ascot.</p><p><strong>Burnt Sugar</strong> and <strong>Arbalet</strong> were the ones that finished ahead of him in this race last year. I was really disappointed with Burnt Sugar in the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket – a race he had won last season. He was in the unfavoured centre group but it’s not encouraging he trailed in last. Arbalet hasn’t cut much ice in Listed races this season and he could do without any rain.</p><p><strong>Vale Of Kent</strong> won the Bunbury Cup but he’s back up to a tough weight. Spanish City was fourth in that Newmarket prize and it’s interesting he’s got blinkers on for the first time as he has looked in need of some helpful headgear for a while.</p><p><strong>Raising Sand</strong> loves it here. He rana cracker when third in the Royal Hunt Cup over a mile. He clearly stays that trip fine but there’s a case to say he’s even better over today’s 7f.</p><p><strong>Makzeem</strong> has always promised to land a race like this but he hasn’t quite brought it all together. He looked good when winning at Newbury last weekend but he’ll need plenty of rain if he’s to follow that up. <strong>Mubhij</strong> and <strong>Blue Mist</strong> are bigger dangers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000503517678-4-e1564146822915.jpg><p><strong>3.40</strong></p><p><strong>ENABLE</strong> looks hard to stop in the Qipco King George. If ever she was going to be vulnerable it was in the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown three weeks ago when she was taking on race-fit rivals on her seasonal return over a trip short of her best.</p><p>She returns to today’s 1m4f distance with that run behind her gunning for an astonishing ninth Group 1 win. That superb collection of big races includes victory in this race two years ago as well as two Arcs, an Oaks and a Breeders’ Cup. She is one of the best horses we’ve ever seen and not even a high draw should stop her today.</p><p>Aidan O’Brien’s four runners are sure to try to keep her out wide with <strong>Hunting</strong> <strong>Horn</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong> drawn just inside John Gosden’s superstar. Frankie Dettori will be wise to those tactics and he has not only the best horse in the race but one who is straightforward to ride.</p><p>O’Brien’s best chance looks to be Derby hero <strong>Anthony Van Dyck.</strong> He overcame a mid-race flat spot to land the Epsom Classic but he won’t get away with that today.</p><p><strong>Crystal Ocean</strong> is, surprisingly, a couple of pounds higher than Enable on official ratings. No, I don’t agree with them either but it shows the level Sir Michael Stoute’s ace has reached.</p><p>He was runner-up behind stablemate <strong>Poet’s Word</strong> in this race last year and he did beat <strong>Magical</strong> by further than Enable did in the Coral-Eclipse when landing Royal Ascot’s Prince Of Wales’s Stakes.</p><p>He’s probably the forecast bet with French raider <strong>Waldgeist</strong> another likely to be playing for places.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Templegate's TV tips</h3></p><p><strong>YORK</strong></p><p><strong>2.05</strong></p><p>GET Starstruck in the Sky Bet Get Knotted Handicap. It’s worth taking a chance on Richard Fahey’s <strong>STARLIGHT ROMANCE</strong>. He was nosed out of a second course-and-distance victory at the Dante Meeting in May.</p><p>My fancy filled the same position behind Get Knotted last year and he often brings his A-game to this track. Any rain wouldn’t be a problem but he’s also got plenty of form on fast ground.</p><p><strong>Get Knotted</strong> is going for his fourth win on this day and Michael Dods’ course specialist deservedly has this race named after him. The forecast rain would be a help but he’s not been anywhere near his best this season.</p><p><strong>Penwortham</strong> does most of his winning at Chester so it wasn’t a total shock that he was able to overcome the widest draw around those tight turns last month. He’s back up in the weights and is probably best watched until he returns to his favourite course.</p><p><strong>Wentworth Falls</strong> hasn’t run over a trip this far for more than four years. His losing run doesn’t quite stretch back that far – just over two years – but he’s still a pound higher in the handicap compared with his last victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000435525030.jpg><p><strong>2.40</strong></p><p>THIS race might well be named after <strong>FLYING PURSUIT</strong> next year. If it’s good enough for Get Knotted it must be good enough for Tim Easterby’s speedster as he’s going for his third straight win in the Sky Bet Dash.</p><p>He’s not won since beating stablemate<strong> Golden Apollo</strong> a next in this 12 months ago but that means he’s now a couple of pounds lower in the handicap. His most recent run came here when he finished in midfield but the ground was much faster. If York gets the amount of rain that’s forecast he will love the ground.</p><p><strong>Gulliver</strong>’s two turf wins have come at this track, including when defeating Growl and Golden Apollo over today’s course and distance a month ago in the race that Flying Pursuit ran in. The prospect of softer ground shouldn’t be too much trouble and he should go well for his in-form jockey-trainer combination.</p><p><strong>Encrypted</strong> is another course winner but the forecast rain would be more of an inconvenience for Hugo Palmer’s top weight. <strong>Tomily</strong> is on a roll having won both his starts for David O’Meara having been snapped up after landing a Windsor seller for Richard Hannon.</p><p>He’s still well treated on his best form and teenage rider Angus Villiers takes off his 7lbs claims. This young jockey is one to keep a close eye on as he is going to be good.</p><p><strong>Camacho Chief</strong> and <strong>Savalas</strong> have done all their winning over 5f. <strong>Muscika</strong>’s chances would not be helped by any rain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000434936808.jpg><p><strong>3.15</strong></p><p>THE weather forecast makes the Sky Bet York Stakes Add up. A load of rain is expected to hit the track overnight and throughout the day and that would be great news for <strong>ADDEYBB</strong>.</p><p>He copped similar luck at Royal Ascot when the weather turned on the opening day. Heavy rain had turned the ground soft by the time they went to post for the Wolferton Stakes and that’s just what my fancy he wants.</p><p>He brushed aside<strong> Magic Wand</strong> and <strong>Elarqam</strong> in the closing stages to run out a snug winner. Last season’s victory in Sandown’s Bet365 Mile shows he’s up to this Group 2 level and I expect him to be heavily backed if the weather wizards are spot on.</p><p>It’s no surprise<strong> Regal Reality</strong> is hot favourite after his third behind Enable in the Coral-Eclipse. There’s no doubting his ability but his suspect temperament is just as obvious.</p><p>He wouldn’t go down to the start the right way at Sandown and instead insisted on going the long way round. If he’s in the mood he will be hard to beat but I’m not willing to go in at short prices on a horse with plenty of issues.</p><p><strong>Bangkok</strong> bounced back from a poor show in the Derby when runner-up behind <strong>Japan</strong> at Royal Ascot. The winner was much the best that day and I’m not convinced the return to 1m2f is what he really wants. He also seems best when held up off the pace and those tactics are not always suited to this track.</p><p class=m_3414085885001448961gmail-MsoNoSpacing><strong>ASCOT</strong></p><p
