God forbid a woman should be writing about sex the way a man would write about sex.</p><p>“These men didn’t get called out on it so it was a real double standard that was really unfair.”</p><p>From the moment she published her first novel, 1968’s The World is Full of Married Men, she filled the pages of her books with stories of love making that weren’t just about men getting what they wanted.</p><p>Her characters were always strong, independent women who got what they desired - and that included the men they set their sights on.</p><p>One of her best known was her second book, The Stud, which would later be turned into a particularly steamy movie in 1978 which boosted the career of sister Joan when she was cast in the lead role.</p><h2>HEDONISTIC</h2><p>From the very beginning she based her characters on the glitterati she met in some of the most hedonistic party spots in the world.</p><p>She enjoyed sex from an early age and always targeted men with great bodies - preferably those who hit the gym and the beaches of sun-kissed California and the South of France.</p><p>The rich and famous she met along the way were often wondering if they’d unwittingly featured in her writings. And there were plenty of them.</p><p>In the Fifties when sister Joan was making it big in Hollywood she’d join her at star-studded parties with the likes of Robert Mitchum and Marlon Brando.</p><p>And in the Seventies she’d be rubbing shoulders with the likes of The Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart at London club Tramps.</p><p>But in between those decades she attempted some kind of family life, marrying Wallace Austin in 1960 and having her first child, Tracy, a year later.</p><p>He had bipolar and became addicted to medication and abusive to Jackie, which forced her to leave him.</p><p>He took his own life shortly after their 1964 divorce.</p><p>It was around this time that she decided to reinvent herself, and finally move out of the shadow of her sister Joan and her father, theatrical agent, Joseph.</p><p>In the family home she’d always faced bullying and cruel remarks about her looks and her inferiority to the true star of the Collins clan</p><p>Her daughter Tracy said: “This was the defining point in her life, to moving her on, to protecting herself.</p><p>“And how did she do that? She created a world for herself of wonderful characters who wouldn’t let her down. If she could become successful in her own right nobody else could take that away from her.</p><p>“I think her first book was in her psyche for a long time. Because she had a lot of trauma prior to that. She found that very very painful to talk about. So to be able to sit down and write, that was her lifeline.”</p><p>Jackie went on to have more relationships, but the most important person in her life was always her daughter.</p><p>Tracy said: “She certainly got into having a few relationships. What her own turmoil was after my father, I don’t know. But she felt that she deserved more.</p><p>“I know she had two men that asked her to marry them and she took me away on holiday with both of them to decide who was better with me.</p><p>“That would have been very confusing for me but, nonetheless, she came back and decided that Oscar Lerman was the man for her.”</p><p>Oscar was an American nightclub impresario 18 years her senior - and the greatest love of Jackie’s life.</p><p>They had daughters Tiffany and Rory in 1967 and 1969 respectively.</p><p>The couple were together for 27 years up to his death from prostate cancer.</p><p>He always encouraged Jackie, particularly in the Seventies and Eighties when she move to Los Angeles permanently to write books including Hollywood Wives, Chances and Lucky.</p><h2>'LADY BOSS'</h2><p>Then in 1990 came Lady Boss, which gives the doc its name.</p><p>But she had to protect herself from criticism during this period too, and that was when she started to wear giant blazers with shoulder pads and equally big hair and jewellery. It became her trademark look.</p><p>Daughter Tracy said: “The criticism felt, to her, quite difficult. She was like: ‘I’m gonna go out there and make sure I protect myself.’ She had to find an image - almost like a shield.”</p><p>Sister Joan, who’d always described their relationship as being “cool”, found a new chill blowing in when she hit the big time on Dynasty in the Eighties.</p><p>She was offered a lucrative book deal to pen Prime Time and Love & Desire & Hate and, including her lifestyle books, she sold over 50 million works.</p><p>But it soured relations between the siblings.</p><p>In the doc Joan says: “I had a couple of relationships with men where Jackie loathed them and they loathed her so it was kinda difficult. We saw each other, but it was slightly cool.</p><p>“And then when I got offered two million dollars to write two books, you know you don’t turn that down.”</p><p>Jackie then fell out of fashion after the Nineties.</p><p>Her particular brand of feminism always centred around bold women using their beauty and slyness to get what they wanted rather than being nuanced characters who excelled through sheer talent and hard work.</p><p>Still, she wrote relentlessly, always using the same lifeline to keep her going and using her world famous persona to promote her novels.</p><p>But it was just this obsession with work that contributed to her failing to keep an eye on her health, and in 2009 she was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>Tracey said: “Because of her past experiences, there was that bit of her that transcended what she may have been concerned about.</p><p>“Things had been so tough before this. And I think her traumatic experiences kept coming back into play. But she couldn’t write it out.</p><h2>'BE FABULOUS'</h2><p>“So she said: ‘Right I’m just going to be fabulous, I’m just gonna live my life - I don’t really want to know if there’s anything wrong with me.’</p><p>“She was told she had two or three weeks left. She really needed to come home. She needed to come back to London to say goodbye to everybody.</p><p>“In her mind that was her taking Jackie Collins out for the last time.”</p><p>Jackie returned to London for a week to see family and promote her latest book which saw her appear on Loose Women and The One Show.</p><p>Her drawn appearance naturally attracted suspicion among viewers about the state of her health, and she was advised against doing anything too strenuous.</p><p>But she was determined to live her life as she wanted until she drew her last breath, a sad moment which came on September 19, 2015 - just two weeks before her 78th birthday.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Jackie’s tearful daughter Rory said: “That’s what it felt like - it was like she wrote her own ending.”</p><ul><li><strong>Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story is on BBC2 tonight at 9pm.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686466248.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686466106.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1837f011-3d3f-4ad6-abf8-0c9fed1edf5d.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000190185327.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1315ec9c-4f9e-4c4f-a62a-094378d43a21.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story - Trailer for the biographical film based on the famous novelist</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSAeYGXcWlwZ5Kku6yu1KyrnqpdpsKmsc1moZqbm56ybq%2FOpaOipqNiwKbEjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html&text=How%20bonkbuster%20queen%20Jackie%20Collins%20taught%20entire%20generation%20how%20to%20have%20sex&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html&title=How%20bonkbuster%20queen%20Jackie%20Collins%20taught%20entire%20generation%20how%20to%20have%20sex" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html&title=How%20bonkbuster%20queen%20Jackie%20Collins%20taught%20entire%20generation%20how%20to%20have%20sex" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html&title=How%20bonkbuster%20queen%20Jackie%20Collins%20taught%20entire%20generation%20how%20to%20have%20sex" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbonkbuster-queen-jackie-collins-sex.html&description=How%20bonkbuster%20queen%20Jackie%20Collins%20taught%20entire%20generation%20how%20to%20have%20sex" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nagendra-babu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nagendra Babu">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./discontinued-fast-food-items-taco-bell-arbys.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fast food fans beg for 5 discontinued items to make a come back - and another Taco Bell item that 'o">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
