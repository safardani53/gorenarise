And former England captain David is his son’s biggest cheerleader, praising Cruz for his “cool” snaps and writing on Instagram: “Such a proud dad.”</p><p>Billie Eilish super-fan Cruz — who celebrated his 17th birthday on Sunday with a cake adorned with the singer’s face and a day later revealed he is launching a music career — has a sizeable 1.8million Instagram following.</p><p>But his edgy shoot for the hipster bible signals he is determined to be taken seriously by the cut-throat music industry. The snaps, which include Cruz grabbing his crotch, were not well received by some readers, though. One posted on Instagram: “I don’t wanna see a 17-year-old like that.”</p><p>Another tweeted: “The Beckham’s 17-year-old son Cruz, call me old fashioned but these pics make him look like a junkie prostitute! How terribly sad.”</p><p>But Cruz should fear not. The criticism isn’t a million miles from what his style-icon dad experienced in the late Nineties when he would push the boundaries of men’s fashion.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Becks experienced his first backlash after wearing a sarong on a night out during the 1998 World Cup.</p><p>He has since said: “When I wore that sarong, people were shocked. It was an outrage, ‘Why are you wearing that? What were you thinking?’ Today no one bats an eyelid if a guy wears a sarong in the street.”</p><p>The following year David and Victoria — who are also parents to Brooklyn, 22, Romeo, 19, and ten-year-old Harper — rocked up to a Gucci fashion show wearing matching black leather outfits.</p><p>David has recalled: “We were living at her mum’s house at the time and she was getting changed in her room — we weren’t allowed to stay in the same room — and I was getting changed in my room downstairs. Then we both came to the kitchen and we were like, ‘Wow’. It was a LOT of leather.”</p><p>The fashion faux-pas hasn’t put Cruz off rummaging through his parents’ closet. Asked what item he would borrow, he said: “I’d definitely stay away from the double leather Gucci look. That was interesting. But I feel like the Nineties are making a comeback so I’m gonna dive into their wardrobe a little bit more.”</p><p>Cruz is now paving the way for edgy, Gen Z style. Unlike the rest of his family, who are often dressed in high fashion togs, he is championing streetwear from teen favourites including Supreme and North Face.</p><p>David said in 2018: “[My children] have all got their own unique style. They know themselves, which is great to see.”</p><p>Yet Cruz seems to have inherited his dad’s taste for ever changing hairdos. Rocking a pink buzz cut for i-D Magazine’s shoot, he has also sported long peroxide locks and frosted tips.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=metal-grills>METAL GRILLS</h2><p>After a period of matching his haircut to Victoria’s, David made headlines in 2001 when he shaved off his blond curtains.</p><p>Last year he posted a picture to remind his sons that he had made the look fashionable. He wrote: “Sometimes the boys need reminding who did it first in the Nineties.”</p><p>David’s buzz cut was followed by a mohawk in 2002, which earned him a pre-match hairdryer treatment (that’s a telling off, not a styling) from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.</p><p>He then grew his hair out and had cornrows in 2003 for a visit to South Africa. Around the same time David had a diamante stuck on to his tooth.</p><p>Cruz took a leaf out of Dad’s book for the photoshoot by wearing metal grills over his teeth. But his nose piercing sets him aside from his tattoo-loving dad.</p><p>Not that Cruz is letting the side down when it comes to body art — the new snaps show he now has two tattoos.</p><p>He got his first, a butterfly on his leg, in Miami where 16-year-olds are allowed to be inked. And a tatt on his chest reads “promise you love me”.</p><p>The body art could be a reference to his rumoured girlfriend Bliss Chapman, the daughter of Victoria’s nutritionist Rosemary Ferguson. Cruz was spotted holding hands with the teen at Reading Festival in August.</p><p>However, in the interview for i-D Cruz seemed to indicate he wasn’t totally off the market. Just like his dad, who married a Spice Girl, it seems Cruz could be eyeing a future romance with a singer.</p><p>On his idol Billie Eilish, he said: “I love her music and her style, and I’d love to take her on a date.”</p><p>But no matter his love life, sources close to the Beckhams say Cruz is the most ambitious of the kids and wants to focus on having a high-flying career. For a while it seemed he would follow in his dad’s footsteps after he was offered a spot at Arsenal’s youth academy.</p><p>But he is now returning to his first love, music. Cruz first performed in a studio aged 11, after his mum set up a meeting with Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, the man behind some of Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber’s biggest hits. And David generated a buzz on social media in 2016 after he filmed Cruz performing the Cups song from Pitch Perfect.</p><p>Cruz has recently learned to play the piano, drums and guitar and has enlisted the help of top US producer and songwriter Poo Bear.<br>He told i-D: “I thought I would want to do football and I did that for a bit.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But on making the decision to go back to music, he said: “This is exactly what I want to do.”</p><p>Whichever path he chooses, he is likely to make it a success — just like dad David.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713768272.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713819086.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713819268.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713819269-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000613915761-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZ2mGc4SPaJqrrapir6avyqGYpmVhbHqosdOsZKShpGK8p7KMpaCknV2ZrqV5w5qtopxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html&text=Cruz%20Beckham%2c%2017%2c%20gets%20his%20kit%20off%20-%20just%20like%20his%20dad%20David%2c%2046&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html&title=Cruz%20Beckham%2c%2017%2c%20gets%20his%20kit%20off%20-%20just%20like%20his%20dad%20David%2c%2046" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html&title=Cruz%20Beckham%2c%2017%2c%20gets%20his%20kit%20off%20-%20just%20like%20his%20dad%20David%2c%2046" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html&title=Cruz%20Beckham%2c%2017%2c%20gets%20his%20kit%20off%20-%20just%20like%20his%20dad%20David%2c%2046" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcruz-beckham-17-gets-kit-off-like-dad-david.html&description=Cruz%20Beckham%2c%2017%2c%20gets%20his%20kit%20off%20-%20just%20like%20his%20dad%20David%2c%2046" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alek-skarlatos-doesnt-want-to-waste-popularity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I Didn't 'Want To Waste' Opportunity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sara-ramirez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sara Ramirez  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
