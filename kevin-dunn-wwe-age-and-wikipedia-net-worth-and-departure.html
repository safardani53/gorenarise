For sure, it’s in the million dollars mark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WWE-Executive-Kevin-Dunn-Confirmed-Stepping-Down-From-His-Role-In-2023.jpg><p>Dunn began working with the WWE when it used to go by Titan Sports, Inc. in the mid-1980s.</p><p>Having worked for a decade, Kevin went from an associate to a line producer, of the WWE (then WWF).</p><p>In 1993, he assumed the role of Executive Producer and later an added role as Chief of Global Television Distribution of the company’s television production in 2003.</p><p>Working extensively under <a href=#>Vince McMahon Jr.</a>, for three decades, he stepped down from the executive duty in late December 2023.</p><p>On January 1, 2024, the WWE president <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Khan confirmed the news</a>, while releasing a statement of gratefulness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kevin Dunn WWE Age And Wikipedia</h2><p>Dunn’s exact date of birth or his hometown is not extensively out, but he is of American nationality & has a white ethnic background.</p><p>Born in 1962, Kevin’s age is 62 as of 2024. As for his physique, he has an average body type with brown eyes and white hair.</p><p>Despite being in a well-recognized position as the WWE’s executive producer, Dunn doesn’t have a Wikipedia page.</p><p>However, his well-documented journey in wrestling that earned him executive roles is available on fandom websites & other online tabloids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kevin-Dunn-Joined-WWE-Following-His-Father-Who-Worked-For-Vince-McMahon-Sr.jpg><p>As reported, he <a href=# rel=noopener>graduated from Towson State University</a> with a bachelor’s degree & subsequently, joined as the WWE’s domestic programming associate producer in 1984.</p><p>One of the major reasons for him to be embedded in the WWE was his father, Dennis Dunn, who worked as an Executive Producer of Intermedia Productions. It was a syndicate to handle all WWE production, commissioned by Vince McMahon Sr. in 1972.</p><p>Thanks to his dad, Kevin would later hold the most respected yet critical executive role in the WWE.</p><p>His work gave a mold to the modern wrestling perspective and platforms to legendary wrestlers like <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>, <a href=#>Ric Flair</a>, <a href=#>Steve Austin</a>, Dwyane Johnson, <a href=#>The Undertaker</a>, & many more.</p><h3>A Great Tale Of Dunn And McMahon Family Bonding</h3><p>There’s one legendary story about how Kevin Dunn’s dad, Dennis, and Vince Jr.’s dad, Vince Sr., got a strong connection.</p><p>As reported, when Dennis was transporting WWWF TV Taping masters after tapings in Pennsylvania, his car had issues and caught fire.</p><p>So, he got out the tapings sacrificing his vehicle, which proved a savior of the wrestling promotion’s future. It is alleged that after that incident the Dunn & McMahon family became closer than ever.</p><h2>Kevin Dunn Net Worth & Career Journey</h2><p>As of 2024, Kevin has an estimated net worth of $10 million. There is no doubt that it came from his WWE career as an executive, spanning over three decades.</p><p>If counted since he came on board with the WWF in 1984, his dedication to the promotion amounts to four decades.</p><p>Most recently, until he decided to depart from WWE, he held the position of Executive Producer.</p><p>It might have earned him a great deal of money, however, the exact figure of his salary is not out. The average payroll of a WWE executive is $210,191, while for the likes of veterans like Kevin could be possibly higher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Former-WWE-Executive-Producer-Kevin-Dunn-Has-10-Million-Net-Worth.jpg><p>From 1984 to 1987, Dunn served as associate producer of all domestic WWE programming. When the company relocated to Stamford, Connecticut, he became a line producer overseeing WWE’s new $10 million state-of-the-art TV facility.</p><p>In 1989, he got a promotion to Producer of Domestic Television, and by 1991, he became a Supervising Producer.</p><p>In 1993, Kevin was named Executive Producer of all WWE programming; it was the same time when the Monday Night Raw era began.</p><p>Under his leadership, the company successfully ran Saturday Night’s Main Event, Tough Enough, Friday Night Smackdown & Total Divas.</p><h2>Reason For Kevin’s Departure From WWE</h2><p>Having associated with the WWE family since the mid-1980s, Dunn <a href=# rel=noopener>announced his departure</a> in December 2023. With that, he stepped down from his role as Executive Producer and chief of Distribution.</p><p>Even if Dunn didn’t openly discuss the reason for his exit, it is allegedly due to creative differences between him & the new owner, Endeavor, who took control of the company.</p><p>Despite many rumors of his departure earlier, it came true more than a year after Vince McMahon retired (i.e. in July 2022).</p><p>Amid talks about the cause for bidding farewell, fans took note that there were whispers that Kevin intended not to work for anyone other than McMahon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC3xK%2Bgp2WUqruvedawnGaZl5p6orrDZq6io5mlsqW1wGalnqxdrLyzwMdmmKecXZmysa3RrayrnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html&text=Kevin%20Dunn%20WWE%20Age%20And%20Wikipedia%3a%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Departure&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html&title=Kevin%20Dunn%20WWE%20Age%20And%20Wikipedia%3a%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Departure" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html&title=Kevin%20Dunn%20WWE%20Age%20And%20Wikipedia%3a%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Departure" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html&title=Kevin%20Dunn%20WWE%20Age%20And%20Wikipedia%3a%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Departure" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkevin-dunn-wwe-age-and-wikipedia-net-worth-and-departure.html&description=Kevin%20Dunn%20WWE%20Age%20And%20Wikipedia%3a%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Departure" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-manzo-baby-sex-due-date-girl-daughter-pregnant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren Manzo Reveals Babys Sex &amp;amp; Due Date  Find Out What Shes Having  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mark-weinberger.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Mark Weinberger net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
