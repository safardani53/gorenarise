The Portokalos family first captured our hearts 20 years ago in 2002 with the first movie, which instantly became the highest-grossing romantic comedy ever made. A sequel was released in 2016 after 14 after the first time. Now, we’re getting a third adventure with our beloved MBFGW family, and the first official trailer was released on May 11.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>This time around, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nia Vardalos</strong></a> is serving as the writer, director, and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3. This family reunion is going to be quite the treat at the theater come September. From the cast to the release date, here’s everything we know about My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-embed1.jpg><h2>Who is in the Cast of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>The film is dedicated to the late actor <strong>Michael Constantine</strong> who played Toula’s father Gus in the first two movies. Michael passed away on August 31, 2021, and fans and cast members alike were devastated. In a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> on the film’s account at the time of his death, they wrote: “Rest in peace to the brilliant Michael Constantine, who swore by Windex as Gus, the patriarch of the Portokalos family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Get ready to pack your bags and take a trip to Greece as the film’s director and writer <strong>Nia Vardalos </strong>(Toula) revealed they filmed on location in Greece. She took to Instagram back on June 21, 2022, to reveal the big announcement of the third movie in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sentimental video</a> for the fans. She captioned the video by writing: “Thank you to Playtone, Gold Circle, HBO and Focus! And much love and gratitude to you all for your support as we waited to film. Greece baby. Greece!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Much of the original cast is set to return for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3&nbsp;by the looks of the exciting posts shared on Nia’s Instagram. On July 18, 2022, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official Instagram</a> for the movie shared a group shot of some of the cast members including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Corbett</strong></a> (Ian Miller), <strong>Louis Mandylor</strong> (Nick Portokalos), <strong>Andrea Martin</strong> (Aunt Voula), and more. Additional cast members who are confirmed to return include <strong>Elena Kampouris</strong> as Paris Miller, <strong>Gia Carides</strong> as Cousin Nikki, <strong>Joey Fatone</strong> as Cousin Angelo, and<strong> Lainie Kazan</strong> as Maria Portokalos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>But don’t worry. If you don’t see certain cast members in photos on social media, it doesn’t mean they won’t be in the movie. Nia included another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> with more original cast members writing “I can see in the comments that you are wondering about certain characters. Yes, everyone was invited back. If you don’t see them in photos, you will see them in the film.”</p><h2 class=x_p3><span class=x_s2>What Do We Know About the Story So Far?</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Nia announced that the script was completed back on September 30, 2021, via Instagram. She asked fans to keep their idea pitches to themselves as her script was a done deal. Nia did give us an inside scoop that Ian and Toula are not grandparents in the upcoming movie, but as for the rest, we will have to wait and see. The director and star revealed that she wrote the screenplay to honor Michael’s wishes at the time when he told her he would not be able to join for the third installment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The official synopsis reads: “Join the Portokalos family as they travel to a family reunion in Greece for a heartwarming and hilarious trip full of love, twists and turns. Opa!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In the first official trailer, Toula reveals that her father’s last wish was for the family to visit his childhood village and “reconnect with our roots.” Toula promised her father that she’d find his best friends in Greece. The family heads across the pond to Greece and shenanigans ensue. They all have to sleep in one room, Aunt Voula is playing matchmaker for Paris, and more. Nick sweetly tells Toula that she’s “head of the family now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-ec-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Nia gave more scoop about the third movie in a February 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. She talked about what it was like filming a scene with <strong>John Corbett</strong> that left them both emotional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We actually have a scene where we’re dancing on a dock in the most beautiful cobalt light that our incredible cinematographer, Barry Peterson, waited for and waited for and waited for,” she said.&nbsp;“John and I are standing on a pier dancing together, and we were both in tears. It was incredible.” Nia also said, “It’s just the view around, just the blue of the light, the water. And [Corbett] said, ‘Baby, look where you brought us.” Isn’t that amazing? And then I said, ‘Thank you for coming.'”</p><h2>When Can We Expect to See It?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14><i>My Big Fat Greek&nbsp;Wedding 3&nbsp;</i>will be released in theaters on September 8, 2023. Focus Features announced the release date in February 2023, sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of the full cast</a> on Instagram. “#MyBigFatGreekWedding3 is coming to theaters September 8!” the caption read. “Director, writer, and star @niavardalos and the entire cast return for the latest Portokalos family adventure.” There was also a statement from <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rita Wilson</a>,</strong> who serves as a producer on the film with husband <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tom Hanks</strong> </a>and <strong>Gary Goetzman</strong>. Rita said, “My Big Fat Greek Wedding has brought audiences joy for twenty-one years. I’m so happy that more joy is on the way.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The film started shooting in June 2022 in Greece. At the time, Nia shared that they were filming in the Plaka of Athens. In July, Nia tweeted that this was the longest amount of time she has ever spent in Greece. “Making this film is the longest time I have ever been in Greece and I am more in love than ever with this country and our people,” Nia wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Nia made <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the announcement</a>&nbsp;that the movie wrapped filming on Instagram on August 4. She captioned the sweet post, “Well… that is a wrap on My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3! I am overwhelmed with emotions, so much relief and gratitude all day, and now hot tears are pouring down my face. Thank you crew, cast, producers, studio, financiers and our new friends in the town of Varipatades, Corfu, Greece. In these difficult times we are living in, it’s extremely appreciated when magic happens.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yyZJuhl2KzosCMoKmenZtixKaww6KloGVjYoF5fJFrbmpn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html&text=The%20Trailer%2c%20Cast%2c%20Release%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Cast%2c%20Release%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Cast%2c%20Release%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html&title=The%20Trailer%2c%20Cast%2c%20Release%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-4802271.html&description=The%20Trailer%2c%20Cast%2c%20Release%20Date%20%26amp%3b%20More%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jas-leverette-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jas Leverette's Wife From 'Canine Intervention'?
