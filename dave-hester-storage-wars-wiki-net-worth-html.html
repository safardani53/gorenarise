Dave Hester's Blooming Net Worth</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Being one of the main cast of the reality series Storage Wars, Dave Hester has garnered some appetizing wealth till date.</p><p dir=ltr>In the series, Dave earned $25,000 for appearing in each episode and taking into account of all the guarantee of traveling allowance, expense account and signing bonus, his total salary for the year came to $829,500.</p><p dir=ltr>Dave earned extra money from his shops, Consignment Gallery and Rags to Riches Thrift Store, where he sold all his found treasures but closed them in June 2011.

His son’s name is Dave Hester Jr. Dave hasn’t exposed about the identity of his son except for a tweet that he wrote shouting out his son at the APA 9-Ball Nationals in Vegas. Other than that, there’s nothing to be excited about. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>4.
