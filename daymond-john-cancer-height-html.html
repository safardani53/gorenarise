However, his career successes aren't the&nbsp;only thing that made him a true shark, overcoming each adversity he encountered in his personal life is also what anyone could look up to, like fighting cancer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Daymond John Has To Monitor His Cancer For The Rest Of His Life</h2><p>In 2017, Daymond John was gathering fame as a major Shark Tank <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">investor</a> in ABC. He would go on to invest in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bubba's-Q Boneless Ribs</a> on Shark Tank, which is now worth millions of dollars. However, when&nbsp;the successful CEO of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">FUBU</a> was flying high on success, healthwise, he was&nbsp;also suffering&nbsp;a huge setback, Daymond John&nbsp;was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in April 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking to Good Morning America in 2017, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up</a> about his doctors finding a "nodule about the size of a marble" on his thyroid during a routine checkup. He says that even though the biopsy couldn't conclude anything compelling, he still pushed to have it removed to reduce risk. His quick thinking paid off as after the surgery, the tests on the nodule revealed that he had, in fact, stage two thyroid cancer. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>John also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> GMA host Robin Roberts that although the surgery removed the cancer,&nbsp;another half of his thyroid is still in, and there are chances that it could come back, so he has to check in every 3 to 6 months, pressing on the fact that thyroid is slow-growing cancer.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He also told Roberts that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking openly</a> about his cancer is very important to him. It could encourage other people to go for early diagnosis and normalize the support and seek medical help. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Reinforcing the same narrative in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with WebMD about surviving thyroid cancer, he explained the need for him to go public with his cancer to remind people, especially entrepreneurs, to keep their health in check. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I went public because one group that doesn’t take care of themselves is entrepreneurs like me. They’re so busy 24 hours a day that they tend to forget about their health. I want to be an example of somebody who took care of himself and therefore can still run around like I want.</p><p>John also encouraged&nbsp;people to go for early detection in the same interview, be it with&nbsp;mammograms, pap smears, or colonoscopies. He further emphasized the importance of people checking their&nbsp;family history with cancers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Daymond John is now very cautious about his health as he wants to prevent his cancer from coming back as much as possible. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> WebMD that even though he didn't care much for his health in his younger days, he started to take care since he hit his forties, said that he takes it "very, very seriously". <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Daymond John Preaches That There Is No Success Without Health</h2><p>As stated in his interview with GMA,&nbsp;John&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">famously believes</a> in the saying, "A&nbsp;man with his health has a thousand dreams. A man without his health only has one.".&nbsp;The entrepreneur has tried to maintain his health through workouts, a healthy diet, and drinking plenty of water to match his professional success.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Inc., John&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;that&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;his health in check has been his major goal. He said&nbsp;that he sets his goal of drinking&nbsp;10 glasses of water per day and avoiding fried foods or red meat.&nbsp;His daily goals include doing 100 pushups a day, walking over 10,000 steps with&nbsp;doing cardio in the morning, and lifting weights at night.</p><p>In the said interview, he also said that his goal weight was 170 pounds, perhaps to fit his height. Although not confirmed officially,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Famouspeople</a> has put his height as 5'7", which is&nbsp;average, and John has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">publically acknowledged</a> his short stature. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Along with his regular workouts and diet, John also stays in shape by playing and staying active with his daughter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>With a healthy habit and determination like this, there is no doubt Daymond John cannot beat cancer if it comes the second time around.</p><p>However, this isn't the first time he has been fighting a serious condition. John has been tackling dyslexia ever since he was a young boy.</p><h2>Daymond Jones Is Dyslexic But Didn’t Let The Condition Affect His Determination</h2><p>As a young kid, Daymond John always wondered why he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">struggled</a> with reading comprehension when he seemed to do well with subjects like math and science. Although not diagnosed with dyslexia right away, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tells</a> The Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity that the professional he saw for his problems in school did identify his learning/behavioral disability. It was only in his thirties when textual communication became more and more popular, he decided to see a medical professional who diagnosed him with dyslexia.</p><p>In the gap between him as a young student struggling in school to troubles he encountered navigating through texts, emails, and teleprompters in his later life, one thing remained constant. Daymond John refused to let his condition define him and became determined more and more with time on how to overcome the challenges it threw his way.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">success story</a> in&nbsp;The Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity mentions that his drive and determination kept&nbsp;working around in tackling dyslexia every step of the way. He mentioned that it takes him longer to read than other people without dyslexia, so he would often seek&nbsp;help from his colleagues to ensure accurate&nbsp;comprehension. And this exact perseverance is what <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made him</a> a successful entrepreneur and a remarkable motivational speaker despite the challenges that he faces because of dyslexia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Daymond John now <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">encourages</a> people with dyslexia to not hide it. His success story is sure to make people open up and inspire them to fight their dyslexia like a champ. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muurnOp5tmop%2Bdu26vwKeanqpdnbKqs8etZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html&text=Daymond%20John%20Fought%20Off%20Cancer%20And%20Dyslexia%20Like%20A%20Champ&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html&title=Daymond%20John%20Fought%20Off%20Cancer%20And%20Dyslexia%20Like%20A%20Champ" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html&title=Daymond%20John%20Fought%20Off%20Cancer%20And%20Dyslexia%20Like%20A%20Champ" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html&title=Daymond%20John%20Fought%20Off%20Cancer%20And%20Dyslexia%20Like%20A%20Champ" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaymond-john-cancer-height-html.html&description=Daymond%20John%20Fought%20Off%20Cancer%20And%20Dyslexia%20Like%20A%20Champ" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-morris-actor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Robert Morris (actor) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-slick-rick-eye.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Slick Rick's eye?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
