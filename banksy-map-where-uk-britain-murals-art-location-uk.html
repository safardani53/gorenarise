a person known only as Mr Eggs - came forward and fumed over it being attributed to the <a href=#>Bristolian artist</a>.</p><p>"It's not like he invented spray can out... there are lots of good artists out there," the artist told the Manchester Evening News.</p><p>Banksy works are<a href=#> prized pieces for a local area</a> as they can draw in much-needed tourism and even <a href=#>raise house prices</a> - but keeping them safe is no easy task.</p><p>Last year, his <a href=#>creations were cleaned off the London Underground</a> - despite being estimated at £7.5m - and <a href=#>others have fallen into private hands</a>.</p><p>While the piece outside The Griffin Hotel, in <a href=#>Manchester</a>, didn't turn out to be a Banksy, there are plenty more of his pieces you can see around Britain.</p><h2>Love Plane - Liverpool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596945461.jpg><p>The Love Plane first appeared on the Western Approaches on Rumford Street in Liverpool in 2011, but it was then removed in 2016 to be featured in a street art museum.</p><p>When the museum never materialised, the beloved biplane painting was returned to the city centre in February 2019 with the addition of a tag reading: "I'm back".</p><h2>The Well Hung Lover - Bristol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/f434ed5e-9f8b-4506-80f5-6665b3d2171a-1.jpg><p>This work, also known as Naked Man Hanging from Window, appeared on the side of a sexual health clinic in Banksy's hometown in 2006.</p><p>It became the first legal street art in the UK after 97 per cent of respondents to a council poll said they wanted the lewd mural to stay.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>But despite efforts to protect the work, it's been defaced by paintballs and black spray paint tags reading 'F**k Banksy'.</p><h2>The Mild Mild West - Bristol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596945464.jpg><p>The Mild Mild West, showing a Molotov cocktail-wielding teddy bear, was painted in broad daylight over three days in 1999.</p><p>Locals have praised the graffiti on Stokes Croft, which was made in protest of police efforts to close down raves in the area in the 90s.</p><h2>The Girl with the Pierced Eardrum - Bristol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596945465.jpg><p>Banksy's cheeky take on the famous Vermeer painting, The Girl with the Pearl Earring, appeared in Hanover Place in 2014.</p><p>The mural was in the news again when a giant face mask appeared on the painting in April 2020.</p><h2>Rose Trap - Bristol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596949496.jpg><p>Not far from Mild Mild West, Rose Trap can be found on Thomas Street North in Bristol.</p><p>Vandals targetted the artwork and defaced it with black spray paint last September.</p><p>Thankfully locals had put a plexiglass covering over the early Banksy mural to keeping it safe for posterity before the incident.</p><h2>Valentine's Day - Bristol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596948823.jpg><p>This work is the newest confirmed Banksy work in Bristol, appearing overnight on 13th February 2020.</p><p>Within hours of its discovery on Marsh Lane, <a href=#>vandals sprayed foul-mouthed messages over the top of it</a> including "BCC w*****s".</p><p>Banksy, however, wasn't disappointed and wrote on Instagram: "I'm kind of glad the piece in Barton Hill got vandalised.</p><p>"The initial sketch was a lot better."</p><h2>Dismaland Pinwheel - Weston-super-Mare</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2461084.main_image.jpg><p>Banksy's dystopian theme park, Dismaland, opened in a crumbling leisure centre on the Weston-super-Mare seafront in 2015.</p><p>Banksy gifted its giant pinwheel to the town as a thank you for putting on the show, which welcomed over 150,000 visitors during its five-week run.</p><p>Now the pinwheel is going to be displayed in the town centre – though as exactly when it will appear is not yet certain as work on its placement has been delayed during the pandemic, according to reports.</p><h2>Game Changer - Southampton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596946622.jpg><p>Banksy gifted Game Changer to Southampton General Hospital where it was displayed until it was auctioned off to raise money for the NHS.</p><p>In a note to hospital staff, Banksy wrote: "Thanks for all you're doing. I hope this brightens the place up a bit, even if its only black and white."</p><p>It was on display in the hospital's foyer near the emergency department until it sold £16.7m last year.</p><h2>Reindeer mural - Birmingham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596946624.jpg><p>Banksy's reindeer mural appeared in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter in December 2019.</p><p>A protective screen was put up in front of the painting after red noses were painted on to the original.</p><h2>Draw the Raised Bridge - Hull</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596946847.jpg><p>Draw the Raised Bridge appeared on the disused Scott Street Bridge over the River Hull in January 2018.</p><p>A plan had been drawn up to demolish the bridge and put the artwork onto a replacement, replica bridge.</p><p>After many feared the Birmingham Banksy would be auctioned off after a number of his pieces sold for six-figure sums.</p><p>Network Rail, who own the wall where the graffiti is, told Birmingham Live it would remain there due to the "complex reality and cost of removing the street art".</p><h2>Season's Greetings - Port Talbot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596962150.jpg><p>The Christmas themed Season's Greetings mural was sprayed onto the side of a steelworker's garage in Port Talbot in December 2018.</p><p>Although it's been sold to a gallery owner, it was agreed that the 4.5tonne work would temporarily stay in the town.</p><h2>This is Not a Photo Opportunity -

with properties selling for up to three times more than they were previously valued at.</p><h2>Designated Graffiti Area - London</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596960760.jpg><p>Banksy's humourous Designated Graffiti Area is located in the courtyard of the nightclub Cargo on Rivington Street in Hackney.</p><p>Another of his works showing a dog with a bazooka called His Master's Voice is in the same place.</p><h2>Royal Family -

London</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NINTCHDBPICT000596960637.jpg><p>The Extinction Rebellion mural appeared near Marble Arch in April 2019 after the protest group's camp on the site was cleared.</p><p>A message on the painting reads: "From This Moment Despair Ends And Tactics Begin”.</p><h2>Snorting Copper -
