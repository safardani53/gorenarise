He eventually dropped his demands to £810,000 for his "hard work".</p><p>There were three interested groups looking to buy Bury, but Dale failed to agree a deal with any of them.</p><p>He is now thought to be willing to accept an initial payment of £560,000 to relinquish control, with Bury saddled with overall debts of £9million.</p><h2>What does this mean for League One during the 2019/20 season?</h2><p>The EFL have decided Bury's record from the current season will be expunged - which currently stands at five matches suspended.</p><p>The same would have happened to Bolton if they had been expelled</p><p>The Trotters have been fielding an academy team so far this season and who lost 2-0 at Wycombe and 5-0 against Tranmere and Ipswich respectively, but did manage a credible 0-0 draw at home to Coventry.</p><p>League One has been reduced to a 23-team division for the 2019/20 season, before returning to the usual 24 next season.</p><p>Bury will have to apply to the Football Association if they remain as a football club, for entry to a league lower down the football pyramid in 2020/21.</p><h2>What does it mean for League One relegation this year?</h2><p>In a normal season, four teams are relegated from League One down to League Two.</p><p>For the 2019/20 season only, the EFL have now reduced the number of relegation places to three.</p><p>If Bolton were expelled, the number of relegation places would have been cut to two.</p><p>The number of promotion places up into the Championship remains unchanged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000511021353-6.jpg><h2>What does it mean for League Two promotion this year?</h2><p>In order to return League One to a 24 team division, the EFL need to find one extra club for next season.</p><p>That comes from reducing the number of relegation places from League One, rather than offering more promotion spots from League Two.</p><p>This means the four promotion places from League Two remain unchanged.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in football</h2></p><h2>How does it affect relegation from League Two and promotion from Conference?</h2><p>Bury's expulsion leaves the number of professional sides at 91 instead of 92, and League Two with just 23 teams.</p><p>The EFL have therefore decided that only one team will be relegated to the Conference this season, with promotion places from the National League remaining unchanged at two.</p><p>Bolton's survival means that League Two will still have relegation and will avoid a scenario where every single team avoid the drop by default - this last happened in 1996.</p><p>That year, Torquay United finished bottom of the Football League, but were reprieved as Conference winners' Stevenage's ground didn't reach the league's minimum capacity requirements.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>EFL must save Bury FC as it sits on brink of extinction</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX26EeX6Xa3BomqWnxm6uzqWrqKZdmrOtecSxoK1lla29prjLnptmnp%2BkwaOty6Vkr52eqcKzsdJmqZ6klZyutbXOp2Spqp%2BivLW1zqdm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html&text=Bury%20and%20Bolton%20EFL%20exit%20%20League%20One%20relegation%20and%20League%20Two%20promotion%20explained%20as%20Wanderers%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html&title=Bury%20and%20Bolton%20EFL%20exit%20%20League%20One%20relegation%20and%20League%20Two%20promotion%20explained%20as%20Wanderers%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html&title=Bury%20and%20Bolton%20EFL%20exit%20%20League%20One%20relegation%20and%20League%20Two%20promotion%20explained%20as%20Wanderers%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html&title=Bury%20and%20Bolton%20EFL%20exit%20%20League%20One%20relegation%20and%20League%20Two%20promotion%20explained%20as%20Wanderers%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbury-bolton-efl-exit-expelled-football-ventures-relegation-promotion.html&description=Bury%20and%20Bolton%20EFL%20exit%20%20League%20One%20relegation%20and%20League%20Two%20promotion%20explained%20as%20Wanderers%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charli-damelio-madi-monroe-friends-again.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charli D'Amelio Sent Flowers To Madi Monroe On Her Birthday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-isnt-eastenders-on-tonight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is EastEnders not on tonight, December 19, and can I watch the episode on iPlayer?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
