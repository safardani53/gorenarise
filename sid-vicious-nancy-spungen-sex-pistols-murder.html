He kind of got off on that.”</p><p>Punk fan Nancy, 18, was a determined groupie who set her sights on The Sex Pistols, propositioning singer John Lydon before hooking up with Sid.</p><p>Loud and obnoxious, Nancy was spurned by the other groupies but was accepted by musicians, largely because she supplied them with heroin.</p><p>Steve Jones - who slept with Nancy behind Sid's back - described her as “whiny”.</p><p>“I was bewildered by what he could’ve found attractive about her,” he added.</p><p>But Sid had found a kindred spirit and someone who could tutor him in the ways of drugs and sex and embrace his outbursts.</p><p>One witness recalled Nancy telling Sid to push a groupie down the stairs at a club which he did “without a second thought."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642100688.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641866024-1.jpg><h2>'Kidnap' attempt to split inseparable pair</h2><p>With the Pistols’ album Never Mind the Boll***s, riding high in the charts, Sid and Nancy moved into a flat in Maida Vale where their heroin addiction spiralled out of control.</p><p>The rest of the band tried to keep them apart and manager Malcolm McLaren later admitted he tried to have her "kidnapped" and put on a plane to the States.</p><p>But the couple were inseparable. In letters to her mum, after her death, Sid revealed their dependence on each other, born from their dark struggles with mental health.</p><p>“I worshipped Nancy,” he wrote. “It was far more than just love. To me she was a goddess. She used to make me kiss her feet before we made love.</p><p>“No one ever loved the way we did, and to spend even a day away from her, let alone a whole lifetime, is too painful to even think about.”</p><p>When she was banned from joining the group on a US tour, in January 1978, Sid became more erratic, smashing a fan over the head with a guitar and carving “gimme a fix” into his chest with a razor blade before coming on stage at a Dallas gig.</p><p>After the group split on tour, Sid was hospitalised in New York with a methadone overdose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642271984.jpg><h2>Suicide attempt in Paris hotel</h2><p>Reunited with Nancy, Sid signed up to film the Julian Temple’s mockumentary The Great Rock n’ Roll swindle in Paris but was rarely sober enough to leave his hotel room.</p><p>On one occasion Sid did make it on set, he returned to a scene of carnage at the hotel.</p><p>“She'd cut her wrists, there was blood all over the bed,” says director Julian.</p><p>“She'd faked up a suicide attempt to really make Sid feel that he shouldn't leave her, even for a few hours, to do any filming."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642243063.jpg><h2>Double tragedy ends toxic romance</h2><p>Their self-destructive binges came to a tragic end on the night of October 11, 1978, in Manhattan’s Chelsea Hotel.</p><p>The couple, who had been living in room 100 for two months, threw a party and Sid swallowed 30 anti-depressant pills before passing out.</p><p>The following morning, at 11am, a bellboy found Nancy dead, clad in her underwear, with a single stab wound in her stomach.</p><p>Her distraught lover was found wandering the hallways, shouting that he had killed her, although later denied it, saying he didn't remember anything about the night.</p><p>Arrested and bailed, Sid slit his wrists with a broken lightbulb and, when taken to hospital, attempted to jump out of the window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/89e4f651-0bcb-49eb-a6d0-f5f02fffa4c8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642243156.jpg><p>In the days following, he wrote several letters to Nancy’s mum Debbie, thanking her for “understanding” their love.</p><p>“I’m dying. Slowly, and in great pain,” he wrote. “ My baby is gone, without her I have no will to live.</p><p>“I love her so desperately. I know I can never make it without her.”</p><p>He also revealed the couple had a “death pact” and that he now wanted to take his own life as the “final commitment to the one I love.”</p><p>He added: “She always said she would die before she was twenty-one, and I never doubted it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642243072.jpg><p>Released from jail on February 1, 1979, after serving two months for a separate assault in a club, he threw a party in a small Manhattan flat owned by a new girlfriend.</p><p>The following morning mum Anne, who later admitted to supplying him with heroin, found him dead from an overdose.</p><p>In a tragic postscript she claimed the punk icon had left a note, reading: “We had a death pact, and I have to keep my half of the bargain.

Goodbye."</p><p>Anne Beverley claims she scattered his ashes on Nancy’s grave, despite being refused permission by her family.</p><p>Others have claimed Anne dropped Sid's urn in a busy Heathrow terminal, sending his ashes into the air conditioning system.</p><p>Since his death, at the age of 22, many theories about Nancy’s murder have circulated, with supporters arguing the rocker was too comatose to kill her, and others claiming it was a botched murder-suicide or that a drug dealer had wielded the knife.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>As the new six part drama goes into production, one thing the writers can rely on is the deep and deadly devotion the couple shared.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"She was his first and only love of his life," Malcolm McLaren wrote in his memoir.</p><p>"As everyone knows, you may argue, want to leave them, move on, and be with others — but you never get over them."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Magenta Devine interviews Sex Pistols front man Johnny Rotten 1987 interview for Network 7</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2Fdn%2BWcmltZ6OesW7CyJygqK2jYruiusKyZKyopaO0prqMrJyxZaCewLW7y6xkpq2imbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html&text=How%20death%20pact%20of%20Sid%20Vicious%20and%20Nancy%20Spurgen%20led%20to%20overdoses%2c%20suicide%20attempts%20and%20brutal%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html&title=How%20death%20pact%20of%20Sid%20Vicious%20and%20Nancy%20Spurgen%20led%20to%20overdoses%2c%20suicide%20attempts%20and%20brutal%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html&title=How%20death%20pact%20of%20Sid%20Vicious%20and%20Nancy%20Spurgen%20led%20to%20overdoses%2c%20suicide%20attempts%20and%20brutal%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html&title=How%20death%20pact%20of%20Sid%20Vicious%20and%20Nancy%20Spurgen%20led%20to%20overdoses%2c%20suicide%20attempts%20and%20brutal%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsid-vicious-nancy-spungen-sex-pistols-murder.html&description=How%20death%20pact%20of%20Sid%20Vicious%20and%20Nancy%20Spurgen%20led%20to%20overdoses%2c%20suicide%20attempts%20and%20brutal%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jessel-taank-moved-to-new-york-weeks-before-rhony-14-started-filming-where-is-she-from.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessel Taank Moved to New York WEEKS Before RHONY 14 Started Filming: Where is She From?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-squire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Squire Celebrity Profile  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
