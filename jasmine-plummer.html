She was born to her mother, Cassandra Johnson, whereas there are no mentions of her father.</span></p><p><span>Jasmine is <i>34</i><i> years old.</i></span></p><p><span>As for her dating life, Plummer is not dating anyone and is focused on her career.</span></p><p><span>She usually doesn’t speak about her personal life in the media or public and hasn’t mentioned her affairs publically. Moreover, she has managed to keep it low profile.</span></p><h2><span>Hallmark Of Her Professional Career</span></h2><p>Jasmine started playing football at 8, and it came to her mother, Cassandra Johnson’s attention; when Jasmine injured her knee while playing, requiring 23 stitches in 2001.</p><p>Due to her Uncle’s persuasion, Jasmine got admitted to the Pop Warner program.</p><p><span>She became a </span><span>household name in athletics in the U.S. for her </span><span>achievement, firstly as a female athlete and secondly as the first-ever black </span><span>woman to do so.</span></p><p><span>The film </span><span>The </span><span>Longshots</span><span> was shot mostly in northwestern Louisiana, most in Minden’s small city. It was filmed at Minden High School and the Webster Parish Alternative School.</span></p><p><span>Initially, </span>Plummer<span> played as a linebacker, and she would take any football match as a competitive wrestler. Since she was a woman of color with a giant body, her teammates did not first give her a warm welcome.</span></p><p><span>The negativity did not last long, as they soon began to win matches because of </span>Plummer. This&nbsp;changed their perception and led to a positive and happy acceptance into their team despite her ethnicity (afro-American) and appearance.</p><p><span>She was a 1.64 m and weighed 132 lb., which made her a bit more succeeding for someone of her age regarding her physical power.</span></p><p><span>Her winning culture was first progressing for the team, prompting her uncle to change her position to a linebacker because of her speed and strength in the field.</span></p><p><span>Although her mom, Cassandra Johnson, did not support her at all, her uncle Fred Johnson was the one who saw potential in her and coached her for the real matches.</span></p><h3>High School</h3><p><span>She became a star in football and her athletic endeavors, including track and field and varsity basketball for Joliet West High School.</span></p><p><span>Even there, she not only shone but also paved the way for other female athletes, with Pop Warner’s football enrollment by girls doubling since her quarterback days.</span></p><p><span>Pop Warner Little Scholars, commonly known as Pop Warner, is the largest youth football organization in the U.S.</span></p><p><span>It is a non-profit organization that provides American football activities for over 425,000 youths aged 5 to 16 years old in different nations across the globe.</span></p><h2><span>Body Measurements & </span><span>Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Jasmine is a beautiful, strong woman with a great personality. Likewise, she has dark eyes and dark hair.</span></p><p><span>Besides this, there is no information regarding her other body measurements noted anywhere in public records.</span></p><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>Jasmine Plummer<span> is a hard-working player; along with earning a name through her athletic endeavors, she has also earned a huge amount of money through her profession, mainly football.</span></p><p><span>Her estimated net worth is $500k – $2.7 million.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Plummer’s Impacts On Female Football Players</span></h2><p><span>Statistics suggest that in the U.S., the number of girls actively participating in football has drastically burgeoned to more than double what it was in the past 5 years ranging from 5,000 – 12,500.</span></p><p><span>They claim that they should not be excluded from football or any other game because of the assumption that women cannot, for they are considered fragile.</span></p><p><span>She gave a new realization and a renewed perspective on girls’ participation in football. She also brought a new approach to football and women footballers by altering the treatment of coaches and old-school football society.</span></p><p><span>Although</span> Plummer<span> does not take any credit for setting the trend, the fact that she played the role of a tremendous inspiration cannot be overshadowed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even after she made it possible to grab the first-ever female athlete’s title as a quarterback, her mother decided that the game should go back to being a boys-only sport.</span></p><p><span>Later, she quit the Pop Warner football team and planned to become an athletic trainer and a WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association) player.</span></p><p>She played basketball at Feather River Community College and then transferred to the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p>Plummer plays as a running back for the Nevada Storm in the semi-pro Women’s Football Alliance. She led the team to a Division III national championship in her 2019 All-Stars season.</p><p>In the 2021 season, Plummer earned All-star recognition as American Conference MVP en route to Division II.</p><p>After reaching the WFA Pro Division in 2022, the Storm lost to the Minnesota Vixen in the first round.</p><h2><span>Tribute To Plummer</span></h2><p><span>To honor Plummer for her exceptional game and for being the first-ever black woman to be a quarterback at such a young age of 11, a movie named </span><span>The Longshots</span><span> was released in </span><span>2008.</span></p><p><span>It is an American </span><span>comedy-drama sports film based on the real-life events of </span>Jasmine Plummer<span>, the first female to participate in the Pop Warner football tournament.</span></p><p><span>The movie is based on the true-life experiences of </span>Jasmine Plummer<span> and under the direction of </span>Fred Durst.</p><p>In the movie, Ice Cube appears as Curtis Plummer (Jasmine’s uncle and coach), who is a down-on-his-luck former high school football star that turns his niece Jasmine (played by Keke Palmer<span>) into the quarterback of the local team named <i>“Minden Browns.”</i></span></p><p><span>He gets his grip back when he becomes the team’s coach after the current coach </span><b>Fisher </b><span>(played by Matt Craven), gets ill.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jasmine-Plummer-2.jpg><p><span>Later, when Curtis became their new leader, the same misfits’ team won and made its way to the <i>“Pop Warner Super Bowl,” </i>which made the small city of Illinois ignite with the spirit the team shared and became the pride and glory of the whole town.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jasmine respects her uncle as he is the one who truly cares about her and is very committed to being there in any way possible when she needs a father figure and best friend.</span></p><p><span>Jasmine looks up to her uncle and honors him by wearing his old jersey number, #11.</span></p><h2>Search Graph</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jasmine-Plummer-4.jpg><h2><span>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</span></h2><h3>Did Jasmine Plummer suffer from Covid-19?</h3><p>No, Jasmine did not suffer from Covid-19.</p><h3>Is Jasmine Plummer in a relationship?</h3><p>No, Jasmine is not in a relationship and is enjoying her single life.</p><h3>What college did Jasmine Plummer attend?</h3><p>Jasmine Plummer attended the University of Nevada, Reno.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2wKykoqaVYr2twcymnKtn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjasmine-plummer.html&text=Jasmine%20Plummer%20Bio%3a%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Movie%20%5b2023%20Update%5d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjasmine-plummer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjasmine-plummer.html&title=Jasmine%20Plummer%20Bio%3a%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Movie%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjasmine-plummer.html&title=Jasmine%20Plummer%20Bio%3a%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Movie%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjasmine-plummer.html&title=Jasmine%20Plummer%20Bio%3a%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Movie%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjasmine-plummer.html&description=Jasmine%20Plummer%20Bio%3a%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20Movie%20%5b2023%20Update%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paul-dano-zoe-kazan-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Photos Of The Couple  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./juan-gabriel-moreno.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Juan Gabriel Moreno net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
