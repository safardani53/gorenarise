Just admit defeat – you’ll be nothing more than the front page of a lads’ mag.’ He actually said that to me. And I said: ‘See you later, mate.’ I’d love to bump into him now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shot05_670.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/byline.jpg><p>Wouldn’t she just.</p><p>Nearly eight years down the line, the lads’ mag industry is on its last legs – but <a href=#>Lucy, 26,</a> has built a multimillion-pound fitness, fashion and property empire, which, along with her modelling earnings and brand endorsements, means she’s set up for life.</p><p>“Am I a millionaire?” she says, reddening from the neck up. “Well yes, with my businesses and properties I am. It’s a weird thing to say out loud, though. It’s quite uncomfortable, isn’t it?</p><p>“But I work bloody hard and <a href=#>I’ve had to fight to be taken seriously</a>. I didn’t want to be known as this dumb Essex girl, I wanted to prove people wrong and I think that’s made me push myself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shot05_583.jpg><p>“And I’m glad I stood up for myself with that agent because that wasn’t the route I wanted to go down, and if I’d taken his advice I think it would have been even harder for me in the long run. There are no lads’ mags any more anyway, so it would have been a very short career.”</p><p>What Lucy did was cannily bide her time in order to maximise the opportunity and platform she had as one of the TOWIE originals. She spent three years on the reality series, earning £50 a day airing her various relationship heartaches in the name of entertainment. But with one eye on the future, she was also firmly establishing herself as one of the show’s favourite characters and building a solid fanbase.</p><p>In 2012, two years after joining TOWIE, she opened Brentwood clothing store Lucy’s Boutique, then bought her first flat. When she felt financially stable enough to go it alone, she quit the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shot02_192.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401592310.jpg><p>“A couple of cast members had left too early and had to come back,” she says, after completing today’s Madonna-inspired shoot in honour of the original Material Girl. “I didn’t want to have to do that – I wanted to get to a point where I was happy and comfortable. TOWIE had become quite stressful and my health came into play as well as the money, so when the time came I was like: ‘OK, this feels right.’ That was five years ago now, which is mad. I don’t know where the time has gone.”</p><p>Shortly after making the break, she launched her subscription-based online fitness programme Results With Lucy (RWL), and in the first year of business – with no marketing, advertising or PR – the company turned over more than £1million.</p><p>Today she employs 16 staff plus 14 freelance personal trainers, and more than 600,000 users have signed up. And Lucy doesn’t just put her face to the brand, occasionally wafting into the office and then straight back out again – she’s there full-time and involved in every decision. “It’s not uncommon for me to be sending emails at 3am, especially when we’ve got a lot going on,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shot05_650.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000346313467.jpg><p>“Our aim in the first year was a £100,000 turnover, so it was overwhelming how quickly it all happened. I was only 22 and we just weren’t expecting it, but we were doing something completely different at the time – a reasonable monthly subscription and hours and hours of workouts accessible on your phone, laptop, wherever you were.”</p><p>Lucy’s healthy income today comes not only from RWL, but also from modelling campaign work, carefully selected brand endorsements (she has lucrative ambassador deals with Bulk Powders and Botanics <a href=#>skincare</a>), and Lucy’s Boutique, which is about to move purely online. She’s no longer involved with the everyday running, but it’s staffed by family members and Lucy still keeps a close eye on what’s stocked, modelling her favourite pieces on social media.</p><p>It’s all enabled her to buy three properties – she rents out two flats and lives in the dream home she has built almost from scratch, converting a run-down two-bed, one-bath bungalow into a three-bed, three-bath chalet. She’s currently looking to add to her portfolio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shot03_263.jpg><p>But that’s not to say it’s all been plain sailing.</p><p>Lucy admits she’s made plenty of “huge mistakes” along the way.</p><p>“One of my biggest was not being content with the one thing that’s doing well and trying to branch out too quickly,” she says. “We lost a lot of money creating and then pulling out of a food delivery company. We had the warehouse, the website was live, we’d tested the boxes, we’d been to the trade shows and seen reaction. It was a big investment.</p><p>“But we panicked. What if it didn’t take off? So we made the decision to pull out and even though it cost us a lot, I think we were risking losing far more. It was a tough decision, but I’m glad we made it because I think it would have been too much of a pressure. I can’t split myself into 10 pieces.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000310447608.jpg><p>She continues: “It was a tough experience, but I learned you should stick to what you know and not push it too far. Build on what you’re good at. It’s good to make mistakes though, and every decision we’ve made since has been with that in mind and been a lot more sensible. More discussion, less diving straight in.”</p><p>Her future is more than secure – the properties are her pension, she says. “I’m more financially stable than I ever thought possible, 100%.</p><p>“Retiring at 40 has quite a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? I’d never do nothing, though. And right now, I want to carry on – I don’t want this to end.”</p><p>Is she a spender or a saver?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lady1-e1524702092259.jpg><p>“I’m both. <a href=#>I spend money on holidays and my social life</a> – my accountant tells me off for how many London dinners I have. I’m not into spending fortunes on materialistic things. When it comes to designer clothes and handbags, they’re still a big deal for me once a year. I go to London with my mum and I’ll buy a designer handbag and it’s still exciting. I never want that excitement to go.”</p><p>Lucy knows that, as a brand, she depends on the absolute trust of her audience. She has watched the <a href=#>celebrity weight-loss DVD scandal unfold</a> over the past few months and is pleased that the darker side of the industry has now been exposed.</p><p>“To have lost that much weight, I take my hat off to them,” she says. “They’re being offered these incredible deals and I can see why young girls like <a href=#>Scarlett Moffatt</a> take them. But what we need is more honesty about how they actually lost the weight.</p><p>If it’s intense workouts and restrictive diets for three months then they need to say that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000273102228.jpg>“I’m quite happy that it’s all come out because I see a lot of girls quite disheartened that they’d bought something thinking they were going to lose 5st in three months like [the celebrities] did. <a href=#>It’s not realistic and it’s not sustainable</a><p>.”</p><p>She freely admits that <a href=#>she has no fitness or nutrition qualifications herself</a>, preferring to leave that side of things to her expert staff and Cecilia Harris, her personal trainer and business partner.</p><p>“It would change the dynamic,” Lucy explains. “I ask questions as I’m getting trained and so I’m the same as the person watching.”</p><p>She’s one of us?</p><p>“Exactly. And I don’t want it to ever become too serious. If something goes wrong, we leave it all in. When you’re working out at home, you might go the wrong way or trip over your foot. I don’t want people to feel intimidated.”</p><p>She says <a href=#>Chloe Madeley</a>, for example, is doing something different for a different audience with a different set of goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000373520261.jpg><p>“Chloe’s [programme] is very much about muscle and more extreme than what I do. As long as it’s sending out a good message I don’t mind. It’s when they’re promoting quick fixes that I have a problem.”</p><p>As the boss of a small company where the majority of employees are female, Lucy has taken steps to accommodate working parents’ needs, offering flexible hours and the option to work from home.</p><p>She has followed the <a href=#>gender pay-gap row</a> and is keen to help break down the barriers that can make it difficult for women to return to work on a level playing field with men after having children.</p><p>“I think it’s mad that we’re even having this discussion in 2018. I’ve got a lot of friends who go to work and have to pretend they don’t want kids to get a promotion, and that is disgusting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000318376884.jpg><p>“We’ve got a mum of two in our office and she works mostly from home and I’m absolutely fine with that. The same job is getting done. Another lady is about to have a baby and we’ve said to her that she can do more work from home when she comes back.”</p><p>Ask Lucy about her personal life and it’s the only point of the interview when she gets a little coy. <a href=#>She’s been with former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas, 33, for a year now</a>, since meeting him on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls – and after her fair share of <a href=#>well-publicised boy trouble over the years</a>, she’s keeping things relatively private. She’ll post the odd picture of herself and Ryan together on social media, but otherwise she remains schtum.</p><p>“It’s really good,” she says of their relationship, smiling. “I’m really happy and I’m in a great place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/backgrid-bguk_1140778_004jpg-js384677460.jpg><p>We’ve had a really fun year since the Island.</p><p>“[Keeping things private] just feels very natural for both of us, which is quite ironic cos we met on a TV show, but it’s just happened.</p><p>“It’s about growing up, I think. We’ve both had public relationships, and there’s less pressure when we have things in our life that are private. It feels more special.”</p><p>Ask her if it feels different to past relationships, and she nods.</p><p>“Yeah. It does. It’s just easy.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Feeling sociable</h3></p><p><strong>Favourite platform?</strong></p><p>Instagram. I love Stories and seeing more into people’s lives.</p><p><strong>Best Insta feed?</strong></p><p>I just started following him, but Will Smith is amazing. His video content is blunt and funny.</p><p><strong>Do you have a personal Facebook?</strong></p><p>I deleted it when I started TOWIE and I’ve never been on it since.</p><p><strong>How do you take the perfect selfie?</strong></p><p>It’s all about the lighting. Daylight with the light in front of you, slightly high and tilted to your best side. I’m not into pouting!</p><p><strong>Social media – good or evil?</strong></p><p>If it’s used the right way, it’s great.</p><p>Lucy had a particularly rough time on the Channel 4 show, which sees a group of celebs stranded on an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean for four weeks, with limited access to water. She dropped 2st, and she posted shocking before-and-after pictures on Instagram with the words: “My poor little body!”</p><p>She says: “That was probably the biggest mental battle of my entire life. Four weeks. Horrendous. I don’t regret it though.”</p><p>Because of Ryan?</p><p>“I call Ryan my lovely extra bonus,” she says. “He really looked after me. He looked after everyone. He’s a very caring person.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><p>“But would I do it again? Not for anything! No way.”</p><p>She doesn’t need to. Lucy can more than afford to be choosy about the jobs she takes.</p><p>“I never wanted to have to rely on someone else,” she says. “That was always my goal and I liked getting to the point where I never had to ask my dad to lend me £20 and I could take my mum out for lunch and pay.</p><p>“I never want to be bailed out by anyone. It’s about standing on your own two feet, and I love it.”</p><ul><li><strong>Lucy is the ambassador for Botanics skincare, available exclusively at Boots.</strong></li><li><strong>Hair:</strong> Dino Pereira using Kiehl’s Since 1851 Magic Elixir</li><li><strong>Make-up:</strong> Afton Radojicic at Stella Creative Artists using Mac</li><li><strong>Styling:</strong> Nana Acheampong</li></ul><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Lucy Mecklenburgh goes on holiday with Ryan Thomas and his daughter Scarlett for first time</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VqaXBoZG58rcHCsmSmnZOguaa6wa6poKBdo66sscNmmKaamam2sLqMq5yapJmpxm6%2ByJyfnqtf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html&text=From%20reality%20TV%20to%20riches%2c%20how%20Lucy%20Mecklenburgh%27s%20naked%20ambition%20built%20a%20fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html&title=From%20reality%20TV%20to%20riches%2c%20how%20Lucy%20Mecklenburgh%27s%20naked%20ambition%20built%20a%20fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html&title=From%20reality%20TV%20to%20riches%2c%20how%20Lucy%20Mecklenburgh%27s%20naked%20ambition%20built%20a%20fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html&title=From%20reality%20TV%20to%20riches%2c%20how%20Lucy%20Mecklenburgh%27s%20naked%20ambition%20built%20a%20fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flucy-mecklenburgh-naked-ambition-reality-riches.html&description=From%20reality%20TV%20to%20riches%2c%20how%20Lucy%20Mecklenburgh%27s%20naked%20ambition%20built%20a%20fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./inside-jeremy-kyle-wedding-victoria.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Jeremy Kyle's wedding to Victoria with Jo Malone gifts, selfies with bodyguard Big Steve and ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./faruk-gezens-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Faruk Gezens Girlfriend: Who is Faruk Gezen Dating?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
