Learn about his location and the most recent health reports. Jonathan James Irwin, popularly known as Jonnie Irwin, is an English television presenter best known for hosting the home renovation program A Place in the Sun.</p><p>He has hosted episodes of the BBC property programs Escape to the Country and To Buy or Not to Buy. He also supplied the former with a spinoff named Escape to the Perfect Town. Irwin is also a writer, educator, and business and property specialist. He began his career as a business transfer expert for Christie & Co. and Colliers International.</p><h2>Jonnie Irwin’s Lung Cancer Diagnosis – A Health Update</h2><p><strong>Jonnie Irwin</strong> has just spoken out about his lung cancer. He was diagnosed with the ailment in 2020, but just lately chose to speak out about it. The legendary TV host also accused the producers of A Place In The Sun of withdrawing him from the series as soon as he notified them that he was dying.&nbsp;He alleges that when he announced his terminal lung cancer diagnosis, the management paid him off for the remainder of the season but did not extend his contract despite knowing he wanted to continue.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jonnie-Irwi-1.webp alt="Jonnie Irwin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“That stung. That destroyed my heart. I am quite disappointed. “I can’t even watch the show anymore,” Jonnie continued. He had informed the producers that he would get documents from his oncologist saying that he was fit to work.&nbsp;Freeform Productions and Channel 4 said that “no stone was left unturned” in their efforts to find a solution for Jonnie to remain, but they were unable to get insurance.&nbsp;Jonnie initially suspected anything was awry while shooting the show in Italy. While driving, his eyesight blurred. When he returned, doctors told him six months to live. He has hosted A Place in the Sun since 2004 and has been on Escape to the Country since 2010.</p><h2>Where Is Jonny Irwin Now? How is he doing?</h2><p><strong>Jonny Irwin</strong> is now on leave and spending time with his family. Earlier this month, the property expert told Hello Magazine that he doesn’t know how much time he has left but is attempting to be “positive” by remembering that he is “living with Cancer, not dying from it.”&nbsp;The 49-year-old is now in chronic discomfort as a consequence of liver damage caused by chemotherapy. He claims he has no idea how much time he has until lung cancer spreads to his brain.</p><p>When he initially learned of his condition, he had the difficult task of informing his wife, who was at home caring for their children.&nbsp;Furthermore, the father of three is concerned that his little boys would forget him when he is gone. He also finds it difficult to enjoy himself with his family now that he knows he won’t be around for long.</p><h2>Meet the Jonnie Irwin Family Members</h2><p><strong>Jonnie Irwin married Jessica Holmes</strong> in September 2016, and the pair has three children: three-year-old son Rex and two-year-old twins Rafa and Cormac. In 2018, the Irwins relocated to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and then to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Jonnie, who was born on November 18, 1973, is now 49 years old. He grew raised on a modest farm near Bitteswell, Leicestershire, England.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jonnie-Ir-1.jpg alt="Jonnie Irwin Wife" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He attended Lutterworth Grammar School and Community College before graduating with a degree in Estate Management from Birmingham City University. The popular TV personality was an avid player who played rugby for Lutterworth RFC and Rugby Lions RFC. However, an injury during a sevens competition damaged his back and caused him to quit.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKaenrJutdGwoKerXZ2yorjToWSuqJSWwaZ51qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2K1qrmMn5imoZyueqK6w2auoZ2imq6ju9Stqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html&text=Jonnie%20Irwins%20Health%20Update%3a%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f%20Family%20and%20Whereabouts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html&title=Jonnie%20Irwins%20Health%20Update%3a%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f%20Family%20and%20Whereabouts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html&title=Jonnie%20Irwins%20Health%20Update%3a%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f%20Family%20and%20Whereabouts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html&title=Jonnie%20Irwins%20Health%20Update%3a%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f%20Family%20and%20Whereabouts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonnie-irwins-health-update-what-happened-to-him-family-and-whereabouts.html&description=Jonnie%20Irwins%20Health%20Update%3a%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f%20Family%20and%20Whereabouts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-cruz-19971212-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Cruz (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./freddie-dennis-gay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside Freddie Dennis Gay's Gay Rumors and His Dating Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
