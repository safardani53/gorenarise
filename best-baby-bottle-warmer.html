These are typically either hot water flask designs which you mix with formula when a bottle is required, or energy-efficient, on-the-go heating bottles, like the Smartech Sleepy Bottle.</p><p>Parents using bottles regularly may want to invest in a bottle-prepping machine, which works like a super-quick and efficient kettle, filtering and measuring the water, controlling the water temp so it's warm but not too hot and creating a bottle ready for baby in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>There's even a self-heating bottle on the market now: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Yoomi's Feeding System</a>, an 8 oz bottle that warms milk to breastmilk temp at the touch of a button.</p><ul><li><strong>Find out more about the Yoomi in&nbsp;our roundup of best baby bottles <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>*If you click on a link in this article, we may earn affiliate revenue.</p><h2>1.

NUK's Thermo Express bottle warmer is easy to use - just add water and push the button and, using steam, the bottle should be heated to just the right temp in 90 seconds (for a 120ml bottle).</p><p>Reviewers say this is a fraction of the time it takes for bottles from other competitor brands to hear up. Another bonus? This design heats up baby food jars, too, and switches off automatically when done.</p><h2><strong>2.

Not only does it heat up two bottles of milk, but it also cleans afterwards. With a high-temperature steam clean, it can kill 99.9% of germs and keeps items sterile for up to 24hrs.</p><p>One pleased fan even found she could heat up baby food, saying 'Finally! I have found a product that will warm food and milk at the same time!</p><p>At the start of weaning, I was needing to boil kettles at every meal (a never-ending process) but this has been a godsend. A super useful product and I only wish I had found it sooner.'</p><h2>9. Best single bottle warmer: Philips Avent</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/baby-bottle-warmers-2.png><ul><li><strong>Philips Avent single bottle warmer, £29.99, from Amazon - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Small but mighty, the Philips Avent is ideal if you want a quick and easy single bottle warmer.

Best for the perfect 37 degrees: Munchkin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-15.13.19-e1630679032213.png><ul><li><strong>Munchkin bottle warmer, £50, from Kidly - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>37 degrees is the perfect temperature for milk, replicating our own body temperature which is not too hot and not too cold.</p><p>It fits most major bottle brands including Everyday Baby, Dr. Brown’s Original, Avent, Medela, Tommee Tippee (among others!) and keeps bottles warm for thirty minutes.</p><h2>11. Best for Sterilising and warming: Mosfiata</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/baby-bottle-warmers-3.png><ul><li><strong>Mosfiata four-in-one warmer, £39.99, from Amazon - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>A parents work is never done but with the Mosfiata you can at least find some help along the way! Firstly it has a quick touch button digital screen which is easy to see (perfect if you are attempting a bleary-eyed 2 am bottle!)</p><p>It also warms milk and formula, heats baby food, defrosts, and rapidly steam-sterilises bottles at a temperature of 212°F. It holds most U.K baby bottles in different sizes, so you can mix and match all your favourites.</p><h2>12. Best for automatic formula making: Babybrezza</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-15.28.13.png><ul><li><strong>Babybrezza formula mixer and warmer, £246.50, from Vertbaudet - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Baby formula can sometimes take some time to get used to with preparing and learning how to mix. Introducing the Babybrezza... which at the touch of a button, does all the hard work for you!</p><p>It automatically measures the dosage of the formula, heats and mixes, and can even do multiple bottles, meaning if you have twins or triplets you can quickly feed them without any fuss. It knows the necessary amount of formula and water so you just fill and go as required.</p><h2>How long can you keep baby milk in bottle warmer?</h2><p>It is always best to pick a bottle warmer with thermostat control, and never keep the milk in there for longer than 10 minutes (unless it has the technology to keep it at the exact temperature required). The other factor is bacteria.</p><p>Leaving baby milk in the warmer is a breeding ground for bacteria, whether the bottle is hot or cold. Should you forget a bottle, simply throw it away and sterilise the bottle to start again.</p><p>Always check the temperature of the bottle regardless of when you bring it out by testing with your little finger or underside of your wrist.</p><h2>How to use a baby bottle warmer</h2><p>While baby warmers differ in size and technology they all fundamentally do the same thing; warm formula or breast milk without the use of a microwave. You simply click the bottle in and start heating according to the individual brands' instructions.</p><p>Most warmers require you to add water underneath or at the side which helps heat the bottle. Once the water in your warmer has heated it often notifies you but then you will have to heat the bottle to reach the right temperature.</p><h2>Are baby bottle warmers safe?</h2><p>Bottle warmers are much safer to heat your little one's milk than microwaves, which often overheat and create hot spots in the milk.</p><p>A baby bottle warmer heats gradually and some circulate the milk to stop hot spots whilst alerting you when it's at the right temperature.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More from sun selects Parenting</h2></p><p>We've designed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun Selects</a>&nbsp;to help you to find the best products that won't break the bank.</p><p>Need a sleeping bag for baby?
