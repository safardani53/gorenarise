"Also the Royal Oak Theater in Michigan, due to the segregation of them forcing people to show up with vaccinations ... I am also not doing those shows."</p><p>"I know I’m going to sacrifice a lot of money, but I’m not going to be enslaved to the system or money," the comedian added.</p><p>He continued on to say that getting vaccinated is "a choice" and he doesn't care about what his fans have to say about his decision.</p><p>"If you have anything else to say, I honestly don’t care," Breuer continued. "I have to stick to my morals, I have to sick to what I know is right."</p><p>NBC News said they had reached out to the venues in question for comment but hadn't heard anything back.</p><p>It is unknown if Breuer is vaccinated against the virus at this time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/210916151106621.1c127e.176010.t.jpg><h2>What have people said about Breuer's decision to cancel shows?</h2><p>Following Breuer's decision, many have since taken to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to express their feelings with his views on vaccinations, and ultimately poke fun at his remarks.</p><p>Author Kimberley Johnson said that "Jim Breuer and people like him are the minority. They are loud but they aren't representative of the majority. Jim and his ilk will be left behind while society proceeds without them. Bye."</p><p>Author John Pavlovitz later joked "I think Jim Breuer is <a href=#>Nicki Minaj's</a> cousin," talking about the rappers <a href=#>recent comments</a> on the virus and how she claimed her cousin's friend got <a href=#>testicular swelling</a> after getting the vaccine, the claim was later <a href=#>determined false</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from celebrity net worths</h2></p><p>"Amazing that Jim Breuer is somehow dumber than his character in Half Baked," another said.</p><p>Many also pointed out that Breuer's actions show he doesn't seem to care about his fan's health as vaccination requirements have been on the rise in order to protect others from getting the virus.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Good!!
