The athlete is very successful in his professional career, evident by all the accolades he has won to date.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>One of the reasons for his success is&nbsp;because he has the best support system in the world, his wife,&nbsp;Emily Greinke. The pair have been married&nbsp;for 12 years and share two kids,&nbsp;Bode Nicholas Greinke and Griffin Greinke.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, there soon will be an addition to their family in Fall 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2>Baby #3 For The Greinkes</h2><p>In May 2021, Emily announced on her Instagram that the couple was expecting their third child. She posted a picture&nbsp;of a letterboard that said that their baby#3 was due in the fall.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The board was accessorized&nbsp;with&nbsp;a beige onesie, a beige rainbow,&nbsp;and two ultrasounds of her baby.&nbsp;She expressed her gratitude for having "three rainbow babies" who make her days better.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Zack and Emily welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Bode, in 2015, whereas they were blessed with their&nbsp;second child, Griffin, in 2017. They also have a pet cat named Wilsy and are devoted to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Emily refers to herself as Wilsy's mother and often posts pictures of them on her Instagram. Similarly, she constantly shares&nbsp;a lot about her personal life and her husband's professional career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She is always posting photographs of her children on social media, and the family of four is frequently seen vacationing and spending quality time together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, she uploads&nbsp;pictures of her family during Zack's games, posing on the field, congratulating and supporting her husband. The athlete takes his sons to attend his game as much as possible since he enjoys&nbsp;having them&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">at the ballpark</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The best thing about being pitching in his late 30s is bringing his children to games. It strengthens his bond with his children because they can watch games and work out in the clubhouse.</p><p>Zack also mentioned that it makes him, the other players, and the kids happy. As a result, he makes every effort to engage Bode and Griffin in his endeavors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Zack Greinke and Emily Greinke's Love Story&nbsp;</h2><p>Zack and Emily's love story started when the pair were in high school.&nbsp;The couple attended Apopka High School in&nbsp;Orlando, Florida. Like an adorable Wattpad story, Zack was a famous baseball player, and Emily was a library assistant.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The baseball player approached her, and&nbsp;the couple soon became good friends. Soon, their friendship turned into love, and the pair started dating. Eventually, the duo got married on November 21, 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Emily is busing being a baseball wife and mother to her kids, but she had a successful career as a cheerleader and a model back in the day.&nbsp;She became a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cheerleader</a> for the Dallas Cowboys shortly after graduating from high school. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She was a cheerleader for a few years before switching to modeling. As&nbsp;a model, she has competed in various pageants.&nbsp;She was crowned as Miss Daytona Beach USA and later competed in Miss Florida USA.</p><p>Unfortunately, she did not win the competition. Regardless, she lives a content life with her husband, two sons, and a cat while expecting baby #3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaLKRmLhus9GeoKejlWLEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html&text=Zack%20Greinke%20and%20Wife%20Emily%20Greinke%20Are%20Expecting%20Their%20Third%20Rainbow%20Baby&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html&title=Zack%20Greinke%20and%20Wife%20Emily%20Greinke%20Are%20Expecting%20Their%20Third%20Rainbow%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html&title=Zack%20Greinke%20and%20Wife%20Emily%20Greinke%20Are%20Expecting%20Their%20Third%20Rainbow%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html&title=Zack%20Greinke%20and%20Wife%20Emily%20Greinke%20Are%20Expecting%20Their%20Third%20Rainbow%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzack-greinke-wife-html.html&description=Zack%20Greinke%20and%20Wife%20Emily%20Greinke%20Are%20Expecting%20Their%20Third%20Rainbow%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-wonders-if-she-got-into-razvan-relationship-too-soon-after-90-day-fiance-fight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Wonders If She Got Into Razvan Relationship Too Soon After 90 Day Fiance Fight">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-fabian-frankel-4825250.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Fabian Frankel?
