Besides that, his birth mother abandoned him when he was very young, and he has barely heard from her ever since.</p><p>As a result, his grandparents took him in and raised him. Hence, the footballer struggled a lot while growing up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Young-Tyrann-Mathieu.jpg><p>Moreover, he grew up in a tough neighborhood that was filled with the wrong crowd and shootouts.</p><p>As a result, Mathieu has endured the deaths of several loved ones and has tattooed 22 crosses on his right knee to honor them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn More About Chiefs’ Star Quarterback, <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick Mahomes: Net Worth, Contract, Girlfriend & Parents >></a></strong></p><h3>Adoptive Parents</h3><p>Following his grandfather’s death, his uncle Tyrone Mathieu and aunt Sheila Mathieu adopted him and raised him. His aunt is also well known as a former Zulu queen.</p><p>A few years back, his adoptive mother, Sheila, was accused of being involved in a $30 million Medicare fraud scheme.

Nonetheless, football kept his sanity intact throughout everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, his grandmother and Uncle Tyrann made sure he stuck to the sport. He played high school football for St. Augustine High School and was very popular because of his skills.</p><p>After a successful high school career, Louisiana State University recruited him. The athlete was an outstanding addition to the institute’s football program.</p><p><strong>Don’t Forget To Check Out Chiefs’ Center And <a href=# rel=noopener>Travis Kelce Brother Jason Kelce: NFL, Stats & Jersey >></a></strong></p><h2>Tyrann Mathieu | Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>The NFL safety was born on May 13, 1992, and is <span>31 years old as of December, 2023.

Shortly after that, several media outlets reported that his dismissal was related to several failed drug tests.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Mathieu left LSU to join a drug rehabilitation program in Texas before enrolling for the fall semester. Although it seemed like the safety had his act together, he and few other former LSU athletes were arrested for possession of marijuana.</p><p>His arrest deeply affected him and his chances of being a round-1 pick in the NFL, and the footballer decided to turn his life around. The former Tigers performed exceptionally in the NFL Combine and LSU’s pro day.</p><p>After his performance, many experts and scouts predicted that he would either be a second or third-round pick.

His career was taking off when he faced another injury.&nbsp;</p><p>The athlete suffered a season-ending injury when he tore his right ACL. Moreover, he was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the Associated Press named first-team All-Pro safety while his fellow athletes ranked him 28th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.</p><p>After the 2015 season, the footballer signed a contract extension worth <strong>$62.5 million</strong> for five years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tyrann-Mathieu-With-Patrick-Mahomes-scaled.jpg><p>In the 2016 season, the former Tigers player sustained a shoulder injury and was eventually placed on the injured list.</p><p>Although Tyrann’s contract extension bound him with the Cardinals for five years, he left them after the 2017 season as he disagreed with a pay cut.</p><h4>Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs</h4><p>After the Cardinals released him, the safety signed a one-year contract worth <strong>$7 million</strong> with the Texans.
