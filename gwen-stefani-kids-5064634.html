In the late 1980s, Gwen rose to fame as one of the lead singers of the band <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>No Doubt</a></strong>, and by 2004 she broke out as a solo artist. After decades of world tours and becoming a fashion icon, the GXVE Beauty founder now can be seen spending time with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>husband</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, 47, and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three kids</a>. The blonde bombshell welcomed her three sons during her first marriage to musician&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong></a>, 57, but now they co-parent them as they divorced in 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gwen was joined by Blake and her boys when <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she got her star</a> on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 19. Blake did a speech and praised his wife for&nbsp;prioritizing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>motherhood</a> over her career, which made Gwen cry. “It was clear to me that she was a mother first and foremost over anything else in the world — that was her No. 1 job,” Blake said. “And now, standing here almost 10 years later after I first met her, I can say without question that being a mother is still the most important thing in her life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Learn more about Gwen’s three children and her perspective on having more kids below.</p><h2>Kingston</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Gwen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eldest son</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Kingston</strong>, 17, in 2006, about four years after she and Gavin tied the knot. At the time, her reps released a brief statement to confirm the exciting news. “Both mother and child are doing well,” they wrote, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV News</a>. Ahead of Kingston’s arrival, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy-winner</a> announced that she was pregnant during a performance in Florida. “I want you to sing so loud that the baby hears it,” she shouted at the audience at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gwen-Stefanis-Kids-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In more recent years, Gwen took to her Instagram to celebrate the teenager’s 16th birthday on May 26, 2022. “I can’t believe that I’m actually writing this but…. a very happy 16th birthday to my firstborn baby boy @kingsrossdale_ I prayed and I waited my whole life to be a mommy- i’m so blessed that God chose me to be yours,” her sweet caption of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their selfie</a> read. “you r so loved and we can’t wait to see what happens next!! got a feeling it’s gonna be good!! love u mom (gx).” Kingston also made his mom an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official third wheel</a> at his brother <strong>Apollo</strong>‘s football game in Oct. 2022, where he made out with his girlfriend in front of Gwen!</p><h2>Zuma</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Two years after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gwen and her ex</a> welcomed their first child together, she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to their second son,&nbsp;<strong>Zuma</strong>, 15, in Aug. 2008. When the momma bear announced her pregnancy with Zuma, she clarified that she would be working <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>while carrying</a> her second child. “Feels crazy to be pregnant all over again!!!!!”, she wrote on a message board for No Doubt’s website, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MTV News</a>. “We have been spending every day up in the little studio in our house, trying to write music. My favorite part so far is just seeing the guys every day and hanging out. We have so much fun together. The songwriting part is a bit slow on my part. … I think it has something to do with the baby in my belly, but I’m sure it is all of the process, and I really believe this could be the most inspired No Doubt record so far. Can’t wait to see what happens.” By 2010, No Doubt released their album&nbsp;Icon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Gwen gushed about Zuma for his 15th birthday in Aug. 2023. “happy 15th birthday Zuma !!! we love u more than anything,” she captioned the adorable <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video montage</a> of her teen. Prior to that, when her second son was just three years old, she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>that the little man was a comedian in the making. “[Zuma] wants everyone to watch him, and he’s a goofball and he’s really silly,” Gwen shared. “He’s a funny guy.”</p><h2>Apollo</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>When Gwen welcomed her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>youngest son</a>, <strong>Apollo</strong>, 9, she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was 44 years old</a> and nearly approaching the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>end of her marriage</a> to Gavin. Despite this, Apollo has since brought much joy to the California native’s life. “@gwenstefani welcome APOLLO BOWIE FLYNN ROSSDALE&nbsp; 2/28/14 (bowie and Flynn =mothers’ maiden names ),” the Bush guitarist <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> at the time of his son’s arrival. Later, Gavin told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>in Nov. 2014, that Apollo’s older brother’s love to “protect” him. “Apollo is so small that the older brothers love to protect him. They were very happy when he was born. They just love him. There is no jealousy because they really care about him,” he gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Voice </i></a>judge took to Instagram to celebrate the nine-year-old’s birthday on Feb. 28, 2023. “my world is so much bigger with u in it, happy birthday, apollo i love u so much,” Gwen captioned the round up of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos and videos</a> with her youngest child. In one of the photos, Blake smiled big for the selfie with Apollo, making it clear that the three were in good spirits that day.</p><h2>Gwen on Having More Kids</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Soon after Blake and his wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> in 2021, a source close to the mom told&nbsp;<strong>Hollywood Life </strong>that they were planning on having <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>more kids</a>. “Gwen and Blake are talking about having a baby and exploring that,” the insider claimed. “It’s no secret that Gwen wants a daughter; she’s spoken very publicly about it and having a baby is something that she and Blake have discussed.” And during a separate interview, another source claimed that the couple was “open” to exploring having a baby via a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>surrogate</a>. “Gwen and&nbsp;<span class=markvx57bjpo4 data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Blake</span> are exploring all options to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have a baby</a>. They are very open to surrogacy and that’s what they’re honing in on if they do decide to do this. Because of Gwen’s age, they know it will be difficult to happen naturally but they both want a baby together,” the insider claimed. Despite this, Gwen has not personally announced that she and Blake are expecting a child together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8awnKdlo6myp63NomSkoZSoenZ8lW1tbGxf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html&text=Meet%20Her%20Three%20Sons%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html&title=Meet%20Her%20Three%20Sons%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html&title=Meet%20Her%20Three%20Sons%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html&title=Meet%20Her%20Three%20Sons%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgwen-stefani-kids-5064634.html&description=Meet%20Her%20Three%20Sons%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./olivia-rodrigo-accidentally-followed-an-ex-while-stalking-him-online.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Olivia Rodrigo Accidentally Followed an Ex While 'Stalking' Him Online">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lottery-results-numbers-lotto-april-15-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lottery results and numbers: Lotto and Thunderball draw tonight, April 15, 2023">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
