Reese’s wife and her lover, a prominent pastor at a nearby Baptist church, were both convicted of his murder.&nbsp;On a February evening, after returning home from church and supper at Milo’s, the couple was murdered at their Banks Street home. Cindy Reese allegedly shot Michael in the head and arranged the scene to seem as though it were a robbery.</p><p>Cindy and her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Brown were arrested and charged with Michael’s murder about a month into the inquiry.&nbsp;Even the Devil Went to Church, the forthcoming episode, will dive into the planned murder, which was fuelled by the wife’s wish to start a new life with her boyfriend. The episode will run on Oxygen at 8 p.m. ET, according to the preview:</p><p>“When a small-town Alabama person is killed, rumors about a local preacher start to circulate. Andrea Canning thinks on this event, which she compares to a torrid soap opera being played out in real life.”</p><h2>Five crucial pieces of information surrounding Michael Reese’s death</h2><h2>1) After a few years of marriage, Michael Reese’s wife Cindy had an affair.</h2><p>Cindy and Michael Reese married in 2009 after the former’s previous spouse allegedly committed suicide.&nbsp;The couple’s marriage seemed to be ideal until the murder when it was uncovered that Cindy was having an affair with the senior pastor of the local Baptist church where she worked as a music minister, Jeffrey Brown.</p><p>Cindy and Jeffrey’s romance began in 2013 when they were still married to their respective spouses. The Brown and Reese families were good friends during the same period.&nbsp;Their relationship had its ups and downs, but it was said that the two planned to establish a future together and had pooled cash and assets.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michael-Reese-1.jpg alt="Michael Reese" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>2) After shooting Michael in the head, Cindy went food shopping.</h2><p>According to sources, Cindy Reese shot her husband in the head at close range before leaving their house to fetch groceries. When she got home, she prepared the crime scene to seem like it was a robbery before contacting 911 to report her husband’s death.&nbsp;When police arrived, they discovered a Piggly Wiggly bag with ham and orange juice in the residence.</p><h2>3) Michael Reese’s wife apparently indicated her desire to murder him.</h2><p>Following her imprisonment, Cindy Reese’s then-boyfriend Jeffrey Brown attempted to blame her. He said that she had often stated her desire to get Michael out of the way.&nbsp;Brown’s court evidence included facts about his connection with Cindy, including how she often considered murdering her husband. He said Cindy threatened to poison or shoot Michael Reese and claim insanity if she was ever found guilty in the murder case.</p><p></p><h2>4) Jeffrey Brown was able to dispose of the murder weapon and “taken” jewelry.</h2><p>Brown’s court testimony contained facts concerning Cindy’s involvement in her husband’s death. Cindy, according to Jeffrey, met him at a nearby gas station after shooting Michael inside their Banks Street house. She gave her lover the murder weapon and used “stolen” property from their house to make the crime seem to be a robbery.</p><p>According to Jeffrey, he disposed of the.38 revolver and transferred the jewelry to a lady on Pinson’s Highway 75. Cindy rejected all of the allegations, claiming that she met Jeffrey and handed him $15 in petrol money.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michael-Reese-2.jpg alt="Michael Reese" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>5) Cindy seems unconcerned about her husband Michael Reese’s health.</h2><p>According to one of the investigators who arrived at the murder scene following the 911 call, Cindy showed practically little concern for her husband’s health. The officer stated she never inquired as to whether Michael was alive or dead.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Cindy stated that she couldn’t recall the chats she had with the authorities since she was immediately placed in a police vehicle. She also claimed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, which she was diagnosed with after the death of her first spouse.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZpuiqrCqrctmoKeen6e6osDIqKVmqpWcrrOwyKeeZqWZmLWisctmqZ6do5rAbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html&text=5%20Crucial%20Information%20Regarding%20Michael%20Reeses%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html&title=5%20Crucial%20Information%20Regarding%20Michael%20Reeses%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html&title=5%20Crucial%20Information%20Regarding%20Michael%20Reeses%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html&title=5%20Crucial%20Information%20Regarding%20Michael%20Reeses%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-crucial-information-regarding-michael-reeses-death.html&description=5%20Crucial%20Information%20Regarding%20Michael%20Reeses%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bebe-rexhas-husband-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bebe Rexhas Husband: Who is Bebe Rexha Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-coco-lee-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Coco Lee Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
