But then she said, ‘People are bleeding’.</p><p>“That’s when I knew something awful had happened.”</p><p>Leanne and former Manchester United defender Wes, who were at home in Cheshire, ran to their car and headed for the arena.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000327207303.jpg><p>Meanwhile Halle, who had watched Ariana Grande with a pal, grabbed her and ran through the arena hunting for a way out.</p><p>Halle said: “I knew it was a bomb. I had watched terror attacks on the news and I thought someone was going to come into the arena and start shooting.</p><p>“Then I was thinking, ‘What if there’s another bomb?’ I was scared, but I knew I couldn’t freeze.</p><p>“So I grabbed my friend and ran. But we couldn’t get out of the nearest exit because it was at the top of steep stairs, and the aisle was full of people."</p><p>“Everyone was panicking and all the people at the bottom were pushing the people at the top.</p><p>“Suddenly I saw a gap in another queue so I pulled us free, ran through the rows of chairs and we managed to get into the lobby.</p><p>“That’s when I saw that some people were bleeding.</p><p>“One girl was sat on the floor and it looked like her leg had been wounded by bomb shrapnel.</p><p>“It was really terrifying, but all I could think of was getting out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000115394952.jpg><p>As Halle and her friend fought their way to safety, Leanne and Wes could hear the two girls’ every move, as she had not hung up.</p><p>Leanne said: “It was the worst half an hour of my life.</p><p>“I can’t even tell you what was going through my head other than I wanted Halle. I was in a state of panic and shock, and she was so far away from me.</p><p>“I just wanted to get her in the car and hold her. Wes was panicking too.</p><p>"As we came into the centre of Manchester there were police cars and fire engines everywhere, and we couldn’t go further.</p><p>“Thankfully our friend had gone on foot and been able to find them.

A lot of people were saying victims were crushed in the panic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000327207312-e1495927554415.jpg><p>“So when Wes woke me up and said, ‘It was a suicide bomb, 22 people are dead’, my stomach churned and my heart was in my mouth.</p><p>"Ever since I’ve been going over what could have happened, what if the girls had gone to get a drink or left a few minutes early?</p><p>“I can’t understand how someone could go into a crowded place, let alone a children’s concert, and do something so unspeakably evil.</p><p>“It’s heart-wrenching to think of the pain the victims’ families must be going through, and my heart goes out to all of them.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Tributes have flooded into Manchester as the 22 victims were named.</p><p>And Halle told how the news Martyn Hett, 29, had died left her reeling, as she had danced with him minutes before the explosion.</p><p>She said: “I didn’t know Martyn, but I’d seen him around, and I met him that night. I was dancing with him. He was having the time of his life.</p><p>“I remember I said to him as we were dancing, ‘Oh my God, I love you.’ You could just tell he was so happy.</p><p>“So when I found out he had passed away, it really upset me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000327207284.jpg><p>Leanne went on: “For the past few days Wes and I have just been concentrating on Halle, making sure that we are there for her.</p><p>“Because she has a few friends who were at the concert too, it is comforting to know she can talk to them about what she experienced.</p><p>“I support an amazing charity called Once Upon A Smile, and they told me about how I can help her cope with her feelings.”</p><p>Once Upon A Smile is a Manchester-based bereavement charity working with police to help victims’ families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict0003264724052.jpg><p>They are also supporting survivors, friends, emergency services, healthcare workers and the public.</p><p>And Leanne, who also has daughters Lilia, ten, and six-year-old Lola with Wes, 37, urged anyone traumatised to seek their help.</p><p>She said: “I want people to know that if they, or their children, are struggling to cope there is support there for them.”</p><p>Halle added: “My message to other people who have been through the same thing is that they should not be afraid to talk about it."</p><p>“What happened on Monday will stay with me forever but you can’t let it scare you, because that’s when the terrorists win.</p><p>“And we just can’t let them win.”</p><p>Leanne and Halle have not been paid for this interview.</p><p>Instead, at their request, The Sun on Sunday is making a donation to the Once Upon A Smile charity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaIN3g5BqbGien6TBqrGMmpqeZaeawG6u0aiup6tdma62s8etnKtlmJa5rbGMamtmqJiku6awjKGcq2WdqrpustGopGaZop6ur62MoKmappSaeqS7zZycq6xdoryusc2tqmaZlqmys3nRrqWnoZ6ceqe70WafnqpdobansYyfqailXZius7rAoJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html&text=Footie%20ace%20Wes%20Brown%27s%20daughter%20Halle%2c%2014%2c%20phoned%20her%20mum%20from%20Ariana%20Grande%20concert%20moments%20after%20%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html&title=Footie%20ace%20Wes%20Brown%27s%20daughter%20Halle%2c%2014%2c%20phoned%20her%20mum%20from%20Ariana%20Grande%20concert%20moments%20after%20%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html&title=Footie%20ace%20Wes%20Brown%27s%20daughter%20Halle%2c%2014%2c%20phoned%20her%20mum%20from%20Ariana%20Grande%20concert%20moments%20after%20%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html&title=Footie%20ace%20Wes%20Brown%27s%20daughter%20Halle%2c%2014%2c%20phoned%20her%20mum%20from%20Ariana%20Grande%20concert%20moments%20after%20%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffootie-ace-wes-browns-daughter-halle-14-phoned-her-mum-from-ariana-grande-concert-moments-after-running-for-her-life-from-carnage.html&description=Footie%20ace%20Wes%20Brown%27s%20daughter%20Halle%2c%2014%2c%20phoned%20her%20mum%20from%20Ariana%20Grande%20concert%20moments%20after%20%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeremy-and-charles-vuolo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy and Charles Vuolo - The Hollywood Gossip">&larr;
