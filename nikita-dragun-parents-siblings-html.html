She has always attempted to be honest and transparent with her viewers regarding her transition journey, which began when she was 19 years old.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Dragun, formerly Nicholas, was born as a boy to a Vietnamese father and a Mexican mother on January 31, 1996.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She has three <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">siblings</a> &nbsp;— two sisters, Allegrah and Taliah, and a brother, Vincarlo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her parents were aware of her proclivity towards feminine pursuits from an early age.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">preferred</a> to play with dolls and spend time with girls over boys. Her teachers were aware of it as well but urged her to hide her identity rather than embrace it.</p><h2>Dragun Realized She Was Different at a Very Young Age</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Dragun first recognized she was different when she was in preschool. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2019 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Forbes, she shared how she wanted to put on a cute dress and feel like a princess when she was young. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But one day, a teacher approached her and inquired why she was dressed like that, and then proceeded to contact&nbsp;her parents. That&nbsp;experience&nbsp;stopped her from dressing up and behaving girly.</p><p>“I knew I was different and there were certain things that I couldn’t show or I’d be bullied or teased,” she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">continued</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, after she reached high school, Dragun couldn't hide her identity any longer. The makeup mogul explained she was just the most feminine gay guy out there. She would dress in tight jeans, wear lashes, and carry a little purse.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But it wasn't until college that she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explored</a> her trans identity in earnest.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She was offered a full scholarship to NYU, but she stayed at home and attended community college instead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dragun recalled her parents being&nbsp;disappointed that she didn’t accept the offer, but she needed a year to figure things out.</p><p>The Belgium native then bought a&nbsp;fake ID, changed her identity to Nicole, and began hitting up clubs alone in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Soon, she started experimenting with ladies' clothing&nbsp;and was startled to discover that she could easily pass for a lady.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">began</a> posting as a transgender lady on Instagram.</p><p>&nbsp;As a result, she also launched a YouTube channel, and ever since then, she's continued to post content about what it's like to be a <a href=# rel=follow>trans</a> woman.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Dragun Always Had the Support of Her Parents</h2><p>Her parents have made several appearances on her YouTube channel, including an interview with them where she asks them about their perspectives on her <a href=# rel=follow>coming out journey</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a 2017 YouTube video titled ‘OUR DAUGHTER IS TRANSGENDER!’ Dragun <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> her parents were tremendously supportive of her choice to transition.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When asked about her parents’ first encounter with her being different, her mother responded that Dragun&nbsp;really liked her shoes, dresses, and makeup from&nbsp;a very&nbsp;young age.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her dad, he knew that something wasn’t normal when Dragun made it to the cheerleading squad. However, he understood that it was&nbsp;what she wanted.</p><p>“And so I am just happy for you being who you are,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>. In the video, she also stated that her acceptance into the cheerleading team was a momentous moment for her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While both her parents supported her transformation wholeheartedly, there were few concerns that they were worried about. They expressed their biggest fear was that they could not shield their daughter from individuals who would be less than welcoming of her.</p><p>Her dad was mostly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worried</a> about her physical health during the procedures and particularly concerned about her brother's reaction to her transformation.</p><p>On the other hand, her mom was more worried about her emotional and mental health, as she didn’t want her daughter to get hurt by societal norms.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her mom stated that she just wanted&nbsp;her daughter to know that they’ve got her back and totally support and love her no matter what. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>,&nbsp;</p><p>Pink, polka dots, stripes, rainbows or whatever it may be… Be authentic, live your life with honor. Honor to yourself and honor to the family. Be happy.</p><p>Dragun has successfully completed her transition, and all her parents wish for&nbsp;now&nbsp;is her happiness. Fortunately, her brother also came to terms with her identity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGijoJqknr5wusikoK2ZXZm%2ForPUp2SpmaKau7W%2FjKygm6SZo7S0esetpKU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html&text=Nikita%20Draguns%20Parents%20Were%20Supportive%20Of%20Her%20Being%20Transgender&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html&title=Nikita%20Draguns%20Parents%20Were%20Supportive%20Of%20Her%20Being%20Transgender" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html&title=Nikita%20Draguns%20Parents%20Were%20Supportive%20Of%20Her%20Being%20Transgender" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html&title=Nikita%20Draguns%20Parents%20Were%20Supportive%20Of%20Her%20Being%20Transgender" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnikita-dragun-parents-siblings-html.html&description=Nikita%20Draguns%20Parents%20Were%20Supportive%20Of%20Her%20Being%20Transgender" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stars-flip-flops-winter-photos-celebrities-sandals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of Chrissy Teigen &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./everything-joe-alwyn-has-said-about-taylor-swift-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything Taylor Swift, Joe Alwyn Have Said About Relationship">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
