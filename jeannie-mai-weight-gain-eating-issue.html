Everywhere you go in L.A. there is a no-carb option. I stayed at that weight because it’s what I thought I should be because I’m already small and I also lost a lot of weight since high school. I used to be a not-healthy 130-lb. girl, all in my stomach, all in my arms so I lost the weight and I stayed there then I became a control freak about the way I was eating and it just became the norm.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mai says people would also comment on her weight, asking her how she stayed so thin, which felt like a compliment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought I have what a lot of women want but can’t get so I better stick with it,” she says. “You just think that’s the right thing to do. I fit everything. I fit the model sizes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To maintain her 103-lb., 5-foot-4-inch figure, Mai says she would eat zero carbs or starches, count her bites so she’d limit herself, and eat nothing after 7 p.m. — not even water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wanted to make sure I was 103 when I weighed myself the next day,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After realizing how harsh she was being on herself, Mai says she went home and threw out her scale and decided to make a change.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I didn’t realize it until I was just inspired by Instagram and seeing a lot of these workout videos and also ‘transformation Tuesday’ — one of my favorite hashtags— just seeing how many people reported they were changing their bodies through their workouts and I was like, ‘No way, is this really real?'” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I also had kind of a spirit check when I was on the show and it was another one of those days where I was making fun of my flat butt because I’ve always had a flat butt, and I just realized as I was hearing myself when I saw the show, I was like, ‘Oh my god, for the type of woman you are’ — I am very against body shaming—I couldn’t believe I was body shaming myself and not realizing it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mai, who now weighs 121 lbs., met with a doctor and learned about how to gain healthy muscle and weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">RELATED VIDEO: Jenny Mollen Reveals a Thyroid Problem Post-Pregnancy Has Caused Her to Rapidly Lose Weight</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But she says putting on the pounds wasn’t easy at first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I got on the scale at my doctor’s office, I felt my necklace and my earrings to make sure I didn’t have some heavy-ass piece of jewelry on because I was like, ‘No way I’m 120,” she says. “I got scared and I found my old self creeping back in, so I cut back at dinner. Then I had to remind myself, ‘No, the whole point is to stop over-controlling yourself,’ then I was able to get back on track and eat normally the next day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now Mai says: “I feel more like a woman than I ever have before.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeannie Mai</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She is also eating many foods she did not dare let herself even take a bite of for over a decade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had the whole burger. I ate the sandwiches. I had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which I haven’t had since I was a kid and that was my favorite basic food,” she says. “I went to Stagecoach and Coachella and stopped at Chick-fil-A. My friends were visiting from Italy and brought pasta. I haven’t had a full plate of pasta in 12 years.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although she is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eating foods that she used to restrict</a>, her main diet focuses on “lots of protein, lots of healthy complex carbs, and lots of healthy fats.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her workouts, she goes to the gym 5 times a week to lift heavy weights and goes hiking with her friends for cardio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My goal is to develop curves on my body,” she says. “I never had curves. Now I want to round out my knees, I want my thighs to be just solid and I want a nice good tush, I want to crack walnuts with my butt.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mai, who separated from her husband of 10 years, Freddy Harteis, in October and has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>open about her decision to not have children</a>, adds, “I know one of the blessings of being a mother is getting hips and I’m not going to have that because I chose not to have kids so I believe God is going to give me some hips if I work for it. I’m, literally, every day dedicating a day to a different body part.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mai says her advice for other people struggling with a similar situation is to look internally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You know yourself if you are at an unhealthy weight, only you would know this. So if you’re that person, what would your body be shaped like if it was the strongest version of you?” she says. “If you can apply that to a health plan to get it into that shapely, strong indestructible form of you, I think it would look different than the controlled skinny version you’re trying to be.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harteis recently announced he is expecting his first child with his girlfriend Linsey Toole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2ihnpmeo7amecyaoGavlZ60qcCMoJiipl2arrW1zaBkoqujqrJw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html&text=Jeannie%20Mai%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Gaining%2017%20Lbs.%20in%20Three%20Months&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html&title=Jeannie%20Mai%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Gaining%2017%20Lbs.%20in%20Three%20Months" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html&title=Jeannie%20Mai%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Gaining%2017%20Lbs.%20in%20Three%20Months" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html&title=Jeannie%20Mai%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Gaining%2017%20Lbs.%20in%20Three%20Months" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeannie-mai-weight-gain-eating-issue.html&description=Jeannie%20Mai%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Gaining%2017%20Lbs.%20in%20Three%20Months" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeremy-sheffield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Sheffield">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hylan-starr-vaz5-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hylan Starr (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
