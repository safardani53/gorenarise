ranging from oligarchs to scientists and even generals - have died since Putin's invasion last February.</p><p>Many of the deaths are particularly strange - but then get ruled as "suicide" and quickly swept under the rug by the Russian authorities.</p><p>Putin's regime of course has never admitted to anything - and has always dealt with the deaths of their enemies with a wry smile.</p><p>But the pile of bodies however has appeared to have grown at an alarming rate of the last 14 months.</p><p>And while not all the deaths will involve the hand of Vlad - with some having more prosaic or tragic explanations - all eyes remain on the Kremlin.</p><p>Last month a minister believed to have privately condemned Putin's invasion <a href=#>suddenly died after becoming ill on a flight</a> back from Cuba.</p><p>Doctors rushed to give Petr Kucherenko, 46, CPR after the plane made an emergency landing, but he was pronounced dead.</p><p>In April, a <a href=#>top Russian energy boss was found dead in a cell</a> in a detention centre after he was accused of demanding a £5,000 bribe.</p><p>Authorities did not disclose any details of the death of Igor Shkurko, 49, but insisted there were no signs of criminality.</p><p>Shkurko was also a member of the pro-Putin United Russia political party, but his membership was suspended following the bribery allegation.</p><p><a href=#>Nikolay Bortsov, 77, was then found dead</a> in his home in the Lipetsk region of Russia with no cause given just weeks later.</p><p>The wealthy Putin-backing MP and soft drinks oligarch had been sanctioned by the UK due to his support for&nbsp;<a href=#>Putin's&nbsp;</a>bloody war in&nbsp;<a href=#>Ukraine</a>.</p><p>Other mysterious deaths include that of <a href=#>Colonel Vadim Boyko</a>, who was shot five times in his office.</p><p>Despite being left riddled with bullets, the military chief's death was deemed as self-inflicted.</p><p>And there is <a href=#>the strange case of Pavel Antov</a>, who died alongside his friend Vladimir Budanov.</p><p>The duo both died while Antov, a millionaire sausage tycoon and politician, was celebrating his birthday at a hotel in Odisha, India.</p><p>Budanov -
