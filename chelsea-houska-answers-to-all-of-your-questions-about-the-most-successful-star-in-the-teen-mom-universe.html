But still …</p><p>Just a few months after they tied the knot, Chelsea and Cole welcomed a son named Watson DeBoer.</p><p>And they didn’t stop there!</p><p>The couple welcomed a daughter named Layne Ettie on August 28, 2018 and another baby girl, Walker June, on January 25, 2021.</p><p>Needless to say, <a href=#>Chelsea and Cole have been busy</a> in the baby-making department.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/12/chelsea-houska-teen-mom-2-photo.jpg><p>In fact, Chelsea has been busy in general!</p><p>She’s accomplished an incredible amount in her young life, and though she remains youthful in appearance, she possesses a maturity that probably has HGTV viewers thinking she’s much older than she is. So …</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-chelsea-houska>How Old Is Chelsea Houska?</h3><p>Chelsea Houska was born on August 29, 1991, which makes her 31 years old.</p><p>She’s crammed a lot of life into those years, and she’s already starring on her third popular television show!</p><p>Chelsea also survived an abusive relationship, married the love of her life, started a family, and <a href=#>built a lovely, sprawling home</a> in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p><p>She’s certainly not one for wasting time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/10/chelsea-houska-drives.jpg><h3 id=h-how-many-kids-does-chelsea-houska-have>How Many Kids Does Chelsea Houska Have?</h3><p>Chelsea Houska has a daughter by Adam Lind and <a href=#>two girls and a boy by Cole DeBoer</a>, making her a mother of four.</p><p>It’s not terribly common these days to see people in their early-thirties with four kids, but there are several such cases in the Teen Mom-iverse, including <a href=#>Chelsea’s former friend Kailyn Lowry</a>.</p><p>We guess it makes sense.</p><p>After all, these moms started young, and most of them are able to financially support large families.</p><p>That’s certainly the case with Chelsea!</p><h3 id=h-what-does-chelsea-houska-do-for-a-living>What Does Chelsea Houska Do For a Living?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/tm2-ex-trailer-8-1024x550.png><p>Along with husband Cole DeBoer, <a href=#>Chelsea Houska hosts the HGTV renovation show Down Home Fab</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Chelsea and Cole’s show debuted to solid ratings</a> and was promptly renewed for a second season, which is currently filming.</p><p>It’s a dream come true for Chelsea, who has always had a passion for design, and for Cole, who has a background in construction.</p><p>Some viewers have been critical of Chelsea’s designs, accusing her of not using enough color and relying on the same aesthetic for every project.</p><p>Maybe she’ll branch out a bit going forward, or maybe she’ll ignore the haters and stick with her personal preferences.</p><p>Either way, the show represents a very bright future for its two young hosts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/08/s10-4.png><p><a href=#>Chelsea was open about her desire to quit Teen Mom</a> during her final years on the show.</p><p>The leap from reality TV stardom to a more mainstream media career is a tricky one, and very few have pulled it off.</p><p>Chelsea and Cole must have known they were taking a big risk — and it paid off better than either of them could have imagined!</p><h3 id=h-what-is-chelsea-houska-s-net-worth>What Is Chelsea Houska’s Net Worth?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/10/chelsea-houska-drives.jpg><p>Chelsea Houska’s net worth is estimated at roughly $1.5 million.</p><p>However, the details of her deal with HGTV are unclear, and it’s possible that Chelsea is actually worth far more.</p><p>Chelsea and Cole reportedly signed new contracts for their show’s second season, and they may have been able to negotiate sizable raises.</p><p>Of course, the couple’s success has come with its share of headaches.</p><p>Currently, <a href=#>Chelsea and Cole are being sued</a> by former business partners who claim the DeBoers owe them millions in commissions on income earned from influencer campaigns.</p><p>The suit could be costly, but it also serves as a reminder that Chelsea and Cole are benefitting from many different revenue streams.</p><p>The point is, <a href=#>Chelsea is rich</a> — and now that she’s a highly regarded star in the lucrative world of home renovation TV, she’s likely to stay that way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/10/chelsea-houska-drives.jpg><h3 id=h-where-does-chelsea-houska-live>Where Does Chelsea Houska Live?</h3><p>Chelsea Houska is a resident of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p><p>She might be the town’s wealthiest resident, and she’s certainly its most famous.</p><p>Chelsea’s neighbors love her unique designs, and her home decor business is flourishing as a result!</p><h3 id=h-how-did-chelsea-houska-lose-weight>How Did Chelsea Houska Lose Weight?</h3><p>There’s been a good deal of scrutiny regarding Chelsea Houska’s weight in recent months, and many observers insist that the HGTV star has undergone some sort of surgery.</p><p>But Chelsea has spoken candidly about her weight loss methods on several occasions, and it seems they’re disappointingly non-scandalous:</p><p>She keeps active, favors a low-carb diet, and only drinks alcohol on social occasions.</p><p>Could it really be that easy?</p><p>Well, it’s probably not for most people, but Chelsea says it is for her!</p><p>But Houska’s repeated insistence that she doesn’t rely on any drugs or surgeries to maintain her physique has not put a stop top the allegations that she’s gone under the knife for cosmetic reasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 id=h-did-chelsea-houska-get-a-nose-job>Did Chelsea Houska Get a Nose Job?</h3><p>Rumors that <a href=#>Chelsea Houska has undergone plastic surgery</a> have been circulating for years, but there’s no evidence that she’s ever gone under the knife to alter her appearance.</p><p>Chelsea has admitted to receiving lip and facial fillers, and the injections are reportedly administered by her father, who is a dentist and is therefore licensed to perform such procedures.</p><p>Fillers are increasingly common these days, especially among people who appear on camera for a living.</p><p>But there’s nothing scandalous about fillers, so when haters detect a slight change in Chelsea’s appearance, their first reaction is to accuse her of going under the knife.</p><p>It must be exhausting for Chelsea to have to deal with constant hearsay and nonsense from people who seem to actively dislike her.</p><p>But she’s been living this way since she was in her teens, so she’s probably pretty used to it by now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And despite all the negativity she’s forced to contend with, at the end of the day, Chelsea is living a pretty awesome life.</p><p>She’s got a loving family, the job of her dreams, and the unconditional support of a very loyal fan base.</p><p>And thanks to her new gig as a celebrity home decorator, Chelsea’s fan base is larger than ever!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share
