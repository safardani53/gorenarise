The clue is in the name: The girls are all dolls.</p><p>Jenny, a 5ft 4in D-cup, is one of two life-like models at the UK’s first ever sex doll brothel.</p><p>The operation, run by a brother and sister, charges clients £75 for an hour of silicone sex. And business is booming.</p><p>Indeed, getting my noon appointment wasn't easy. Thursday was fully booked, and Friday night?

There is also a cold, bare kitchen with a bin bag in one corner and a change of clothes for the dolls scattered across the work surface.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pmnip3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389287292.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389287308.jpg><p>I ask the madam if there are any ground rules.</p><p>She replies: “So long as you pay and you leave within the time limit, you can do whatever you want.”</p><p>I hand her £50 for half an hour and am directed to a door.</p><p>Seeing Jenny comes as a shock.</p><p>This obviously plastic mannequin is more like horror movie puppet Chucky than Belle de Jour.</p><p>Glassy-eyed Jenny — retail price £1,700 — is made of a soft, rubber-like material squishy to the touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict0003892874981.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390354963-e1520368927630.jpg><p>It reminds me of the Stretch Armstrong action figure I played with as a child.</p><p>The cramped room, which stinks of latex, just has a bed, with a pink fitted sheet and two pillows.</p><p>There is no duvet. I guess people do not want to cuddle up and spoon with Jenny after they have finished.</p><p>On the side is a small towel with two condoms on top. Punters are asked to use them for hygiene reasons.</p><p>I try moving Jenny so I can take pictures for this article but she is surprisingly heavy.</p><p>Her limbs can be moved thanks to her bendy skeleton — and they have been left in a mangled state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389287507.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tp-image-sex-doll-brothel.jpg><p>Her digits are sticking out at odd angles like she has lost a fight with a piece of agricultural equipment.</p><p>At one point her wig pops off.</p><p>I do not think I have felt so embarrassed in front of a woman since secondary school.</p><p>It is an utterly depressing scene.
