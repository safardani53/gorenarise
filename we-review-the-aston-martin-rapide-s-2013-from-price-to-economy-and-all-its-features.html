Aston Martin this week launched the sensational Rapide S, the world’s most beautiful four-seater sports car.</p><p>It’s also the perfect present for Aston Martin to celebrate their 100th anniversary this year.</p><p>Motors this week has a first drive of the Rapide S on UK roads – and an in-depth interview with the German boss who has transformed the famous British firm in the past decade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1478-thumb-604x270.jpg><h4><b>THE BIG INTERVIEW</b></h4><p><b>HE is the man who has done more for Aston Martin than James Bond.</b></p><p>For the past 13 years, Ulrich Bez has been the mastermind who turned Aston Martin from sporting pretender to the coolest car brand on the planet.</p><p>But the German engineer who learned his trade with Porsche and BMW admits: “I didn’t know anything about Aston when I arrived, I’d never even driven an Aston Martin car.”</p><p>He says he was attracted by the brand.</p><p>He says: “Aston Martin cars didn’t mean anything to me, but it was a brand I knew, like most people, because of James Bond.</p><p>“But I knew if we got the right products it could become a global brand that could challenge Ferrari.”</p><p>Bez also knew he was not everyone’s choice to be the boss and smiles when he remembers a senior executive openly questioning a German being in charge of the British brand.</p><p>But Bez has a reputation for not only being a brilliant engineer but also a perfectionist used to getting his own way and delivering great cars.</p><p>His impressive CV includes playing a key role in the development of the original BMW 3.5 and 7 Series, followed by the legendary 993 at Porsche.</p><p>But Aston was the first time Bez had total control of a car company, albeit reporting to their American owners of the time, Ford.</p><p>He found a company with a great name but just one sub-standard product, the DB7, and two factories — one a converted barn at Bloxham, Oxon, and the other a rundown facility at Newport Pagnell, Bucks.</p><p>Today Aston have a state-of-the-art factory at Gaydon, Warks, a line-up of glamorous models and instead of selling 600 cars a year they sell nearly 4,000.</p><p>Bez’s vision has also stretched to Aston’s first £1million-plus supercar, the 1-77, Aston’s first small car in the Cygnet, and their first four-door coupe, the Rapide.</p><p>The James Bond franchise and 007 himself has fallen back in love with Aston — Daniel Craig picked up his last month.</p><p>But it’s been a turbulent ride on the way. In his first week, Bez caused a strike when he banned workers at the Bloxham factory from eating beside the cars on the factory floor.</p><p>The strike was over in a week as the workers became the first to realise that Bez’s word was now law.</p><p>It was the first of many contentious decisions by Bez, all geared to his relentless drive for perfection and obsession with the quality he knew was needed.</p><p>Bez’s assessment after his first drive of the DB7 in 2000 was simple: “It was not up to my standards. I knew we had to immediately improve everything about the way we built our cars and their quality.”</p><p>His next decision was to postpone the launch of the Vanquish for a year because it wasn’t right.</p><p>Then he axed a planned mid-engined Aston and replaced it with the DB9 and the V8 Vantage.</p><p>But his biggest decision was to start a programme to develop a new body system that would allow Aston to make endless different models off the same chassis.</p><p>Bez also knew he had to give Aston a new, modern design identity to get them noticed again.</p><p>Brit firm back on top ... thanks to German Ulrich Bez, here with Ken Gibson</p><p>He says: “In 2000, no one apart from enthusiasts knew about Aston Martin outside the UK. We had to get a global visibility and I believed that every model had to instantly look like an Aston.”</p><p>He reveals that he would have liked a ground-breaking SUV model on the road by now. But he says the global recession of 2008 hit Aston and their Middle Eastern owners hard.</p><p>He says: “The economic situation slowed down the steps we wanted to take and put us back years.</p><p>“Of course I would like an Aston SUV, it is very important.”</p><p>Bez has a clear vision of the next five years, with a target of 7,000 sales a year based on the core sports models such as the DB9, Vanquish, Vantage and newly face-lifted Rapide S, plus hopefully an SUV.</p><p>Ironically, the most German of Germans, Ulrich Bez believes his biggest influence at Aston has been one thing.</p><p>He says: “Aston Martin now stands for the best of British and people love the firm because it’s British, and that is my biggest pleasure.”</p><p>At the age of 70, Bez is clearly not the long-term leader for Aston and he says he will be happy to hand over the reins.</p><p>He says: “If there is somebody with the personality, character and vision to be the front man for Aston, that is fine.”</p><p>They will have a mighty tough act to follow.</p><h4><b>ROAD TEST: ASTON MARTIN RAPIDE S</b></h4><p><b>I LIKE cars that live up to their name and the Rapide S does – big time.</b></p><p>The S stands for Sport, a commodity this car has by the bucket-load.</p><p>It also happens to be the most beautiful four-seater sports car in the world – but it now has a much more assertive face thanks to a gaping and menacing grille.</p><p>Beautiful ... Aston Martin Rapide S</p><p>This sets the sporting tone for the Rapide S that is rounded off by an aggressive rear end, featuring a boot lid flip that counteracts lift at high speeds.</p><p>And high speed is what the new Rapide S has been built for – with power from the 6litre V12 engine boosted from 470bhp to 550bhp, cutting the 0 to 62mph time to 5.2 seconds and blasting the top speed up to 190mph.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More Motors</h2></p><p>The engine sounds sublime – a deep, glorious burble that explodes into a raging roar when you flatten the accelerator.</p><p>To complete the impressive figures, despite the extra power the Rapide S is more economical at 19.9mpg and CO2 emissions have been cut to 332g/km.</p><p>Engineers have also worked hard to improve the stability of the car at high speeds and a test drive in the Cotswolds underlined it was very much mission accomplished.</p><p>The Rapide S has a balance and agility that defy its 5,020mm length and it handles twisty, demanding country roads with the agility of a pure two-seat sports car.</p><p>Luxury Four people can do long journeys at well in excess of 100mph in silence, although the intimate back seats remain best for children or small adults because the S is not really a saloon car.</p><p>But anyone sitting inside the Rapide S will feel special as they are bathed in luxury with sports seats finished in a unique black and red interweaved perforated leather alongside carbon fibre and piano black trim.</p><p>In many ways, the new Rapide S is the perfect example of Ulrich Bez’s Aston Martin – a compelling mix of beauty, luxury and power with just a dash of four-seat practicality. All you need is £144,950 to buy one.</p><p>But the best news is that production of the Rapide S has been moved back to Gaydon, Warks, from Austria, making it very good news for British jobs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgphtanBvX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ5wKyrqKZdoq6zwMinZKuZoJ6xpnnSZmlpaWNis7O7zGanq6GTmnq1u4yemqimn6LGbq3NnWSapJxitrW%2FjJ%2Bcmqylp7K0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html&text=We%20review%20the%20Aston%20Martin%20Rapide%20S%20%282013%29%20from%20price%20to%20economy%20and%20all%20it&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Aston%20Martin%20Rapide%20S%20%282013%29%20from%20price%20to%20economy%20and%20all%20it" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Aston%20Martin%20Rapide%20S%20%282013%29%20from%20price%20to%20economy%20and%20all%20it" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Aston%20Martin%20Rapide%20S%20%282013%29%20from%20price%20to%20economy%20and%20all%20it" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwe-review-the-aston-martin-rapide-s-2013-from-price-to-economy-and-all-its-features.html&description=We%20review%20the%20Aston%20Martin%20Rapide%20S%20%282013%29%20from%20price%20to%20economy%20and%20all%20it" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cedar-wright-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cedar Wright Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ozzy-sharon-osbourne-grandkids-4752852.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet All Their Grandchildren  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
