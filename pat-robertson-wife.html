The former presidential candidate and Christian Coalition founder's family was at the center of his life, including Pat's wife, Dede.</p><p>Dede died a year before her husband at the age of 94. When did the couple meet? Did they have any children? Let's get to know more about Pat and Dede's life together, which started when they met in the 1950s.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pat Robertson met his wife in 1952 — and they remained married until her death in 2022.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: CBN News</a></figure><p>Dede — born Adelia Elmer — and Pat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first crossed paths</a> at Yale University in 1952. The Ohio native held a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University and a master's from Yale.</p><p>She later converted from Catholicism to born-again Christianity when the Robertsons launched the Christian Broadcasting Network.</p><p>Although their marriage was an enduring one, at times, Dede struggled with her Southern-born husband's traditional beliefs. “I was a Northerner, and Northern men just generally help around the house a little more. I noticed the further south we moved, the less he did," she wrote in her autobiography.</p><p>But she also admitted that Pat's work was extremely important and Dede was a founding member of the CBN. She and Pat also raised four children, even as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served in important roles</a> such as principal U.S. delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women, and wrote numerous books, among other impressive accomplishments.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pat and Dede Robertson had four kids together, some of whom worked at CBN.</h2><p>The Robertsons were parents of four in addition to being world renowned <a href=#>Christian leaders</a>.

She was always working behind the scenes. If it weren’t for Mom, there wouldn’t be a CBN.”</p><p>Tim hosted the CBN's banner show The 700 Club and has served as a televangelist on the network in other capacities.
