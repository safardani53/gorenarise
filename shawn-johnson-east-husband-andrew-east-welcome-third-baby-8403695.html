Not trying to rush anything and really just going to soak it all in. The third time around feels so surreal because even though we've done this twice before, there's still so much nervousness and excitement around the days leading up to the birth and then so much magic once you get to hold your sweet baby in your arms for the first time," she shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It really never gets old. You spend your whole pregnancy wondering how you could possibly love another baby just as much as your first two and then in an instant your heart expands and basically triples in size, it's incredible.

My dad was born on December 9 and passed away unexpectedly on December 27 of last year, so December is a really impactful month for us. Having our baby born so close to my dad's birthday feels really special and I know he would be smiling down and so proud of us," he shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's been amazing to see Shawn push through another C-section with a smile on her face and love this baby with everything she has.

I think just knowing there's a locked door upstairs has made the suspense even harder for our kids so they're thrilled to be able to run around in there and have another baby in the house to play with. I can't wait to see the three of them grow up together."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Shawn Johnson East and Andrew East with daughter Drew and son Jett.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Shawn Johnson /Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Halloween, the former professional athlete kept busy on the spookiest day of the year, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sharing her family's celebrations to her Instagram</a>.

Drew was all smiles in the sweet photos posted by Johnson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the Olympic gold medalist herself, she dressed as a witch — which she called a "🤰witch" in the caption, referring to her baby bump.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After announcing that she was expecting her third baby, Johnson East talked with PEOPLE <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>about her baby on the way and life with her two kids</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[I] was just feeling off and took a pregnancy test," Johnson East told PEOPLE of finding out the exciting news.
