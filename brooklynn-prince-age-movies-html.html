At just the age of 11, Prince has been part of many successful projects like The Turning and Home Before Dark, among others.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her breakthrough role in 2017’s The Florida Project won her many accolades. Her character Moonee, a 6-year-old precocious child, won her the Critics' Choice Movie Awards for Best Young Performer in 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Where is Brooklynn Prince From?</h2><p>Born on May 4, 2010, the talented young actress is from Florida, U.S. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first word</a> was ‘hi.’ Prince revealed she was not a shy baby and would say hi to everyone she met.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress&nbsp;is the oldest daughter of Justin Prince and Courtney Prince. She has a younger brother named Cullen, who is four. Her mother started as an agent but is currently an acting coach.&nbsp;</p><p>Her parents are her biggest supporters and have been with her in every step of her career. The young star constantly shares pictures with her family on her Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The young actress is very close to her family. Last year, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrated</a> her 10th birthday in quarantine, making the best out of it. Her parents baked her a cake and decorated the entire house with streamers, candies, and balloons. Her relatives from both her parents' side had also called her to congratulate her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Did Brooklynn Prince Get Into Acting?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Prince started her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a> when she was just 2. Her grandmother saw her potential and urged her mother to take Prince for auditions. So her parents took her to model and acting auditions, and from there, Prince developed her love for acting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Her first project was a photo shoot for Parenting Magazine. Apart from it, she has also appeared in advertisements for companies like Chuck E. Cheese's and Visit Orlando. Before getting her big break in The Florida Project, she had landed the role of Mira Perry in Anthony Steven Giordano’s movie Robo-Dog: Airborne.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>How Did Brooklynn Prince Land The Role Of Moonee?</h2><p>The young star revealed her mother got a call from the movie producers and was called in for an audition. She auditioned with Christopher Rivera, who plays Scooty in the movie.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Within seconds of her audition, her director Sean Baker was impressed with her and knew immediately she would be in the movie. A couple of days later, she found out she was booked for the film. She was coached by Samantha Quan for the movie. However, she was a natural and would memorize every line and could improvise as well.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Since then, she has worked on many projects with 12 movie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">credits</a> under her name. Prince is not just a talented actress but also a splendid voice actress. She has also worked as a voice actor for movies like The LEGO Movie 2 and The Angry Birds Movie 2.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Brooklynn Prince’s Directorial Debut</h2><p>The young star is a girl with many talents. She directed her first short movie titled Colours&nbsp;in 2019. It stars actors like Fleur Delahunty, Aadila Dosani, and Mila Morgan in the lead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her inspiration for wanting to be a director started from the set of The Florida Project. Watching Baker’s work, vision and creativity influenced her dream to direct. So it won’t come off as a surprise if Prince further pursues her journey as a director.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Is Brooklynn Prince Up To?</h2><p>Season 2 of the Apple TV+ series&nbsp;Home Before Dark is very close to its premiere on June 11, 2021. The series is based on the actual story of a young journalist, Hilde Lisko. Jim Sturgess, and Abby Miller, play her parents in the series, and actors like Louis Herthum and Michael Weston are also included in the cast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The second season is a one-year leap from the closure of the Richie Fife case, and it will follow a new adventure for the young journalist. In a recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Screen Rant, the young actress revealed that her character would dive deeper into the world of journalism together with her dad. Along with it, she will also develop a meaningful bond with Izzy. After the separation, the entire family will grow closer this season while embracing their new life together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her Wyatt Rockefeller-directed movie Settlers is also due to release on June 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2FsLvKpbCnpl2lv6q6wp5kmp%2BVYrqwwsieqmegpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html&text=Brooklynn%20Prince%20Is%20a%20Superstar%20in%20the%20Making%20at%20a%20Young%20Age&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html&title=Brooklynn%20Prince%20Is%20a%20Superstar%20in%20the%20Making%20at%20a%20Young%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html&title=Brooklynn%20Prince%20Is%20a%20Superstar%20in%20the%20Making%20at%20a%20Young%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html&title=Brooklynn%20Prince%20Is%20a%20Superstar%20in%20the%20Making%20at%20a%20Young%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrooklynn-prince-age-movies-html.html&description=Brooklynn%20Prince%20Is%20a%20Superstar%20in%20the%20Making%20at%20a%20Young%20Age" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./inside-caelynn-miller-keyes-bachelorette-weekend-exclusive-7644182.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caelynn Miller-Keyes' Bachelorette Party Weekend Details (Exclusive)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aimee-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aimee Song">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
