Their band had iconic hits like “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” and “You Should Be Dancing” before exploding to fame when they made the soundtrack for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Saturday Night Fever</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barry and Linda's first son, Stephen, was born in 1973. Four years later, Ashley joined the family. In 1981, Travis was born and three years later, Barry and Linda welcomed Michael. Their youngest, and only daughter, Alexandra, was born in 1991.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family lived in both Miami and London while the kids grew up but Barry told PEOPLE in 1989 that his kids also came on tour. “I can’t imagine what it is like to be a successful pop star without a family to support you,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the 1980s, the Bee Gees was embroiled in record company battles that stopped them from releasing albums for eight years, but Barry said that this break was actually a good thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They were the happiest years of our lives because we were raising our kids,” he said. “We were writing and producing songs for other people, which didn’t take up 100 percent of our time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Barry is a solo artist who often collaborates with his sons Stephen and Ashley on new music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here is everything to know about Barry Gibb’s five children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stephen-gibb-50></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stephen Gibb, 50</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Barry Gibb's son Stephen Gibb attends the GRAMMY U Conference at Gibson Guitar Showroom on April 7, 2018 in Miami, Florida.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>John Parra/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda and Barry welcomed their first son, Stephen, on Dec. 1, 1973.

Maurice's daughter Samantha also played with the band.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a thrill to look left and see Sami and to look to my right and see my eldest son,” Barry told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Australian</a> at the time. “And they are both fantastic."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephen and his brother Ashley collaborated with their father in a big way in 2016, co-writing his album In the Now. Barry told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Billboard</a> that he needed his sons' energy to get back into music. “They give me that youth,” he said at the time of the album's release. “They give me that fire.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It seems Stephen feels influenced by his dad as well. On Sept. 1, 2020, Barry's eldest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a photo on Instagram</a> of his parents on their wedding day. “Happy 50th Anniversary to these two crazy kids and happy 74th birthday @officialbarrygibb," he wrote in the caption. "You both continue to inspire and motivate me to be a better man. I could not love you more."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephen has been married to Gloria Levas since 2002, and they have two children: Angus and Nina Gibb.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ashley-gibb-46></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ashley Gibb, 46</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Barry Gibb and his son Ashley Gibb attending the O2 Silver Clef Awards 2017 held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ian West/PA Images/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linda and Barry welcomed their son Ashley on Sept. 8, 1977. He didn’t set out to become a songwriter — most of his life has been focused on tennis — but thanks to his musical family, he’s found success in the industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2005, Barry was asked to collaborate on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbra Streisand</a>’s Guilty Pleasures album, the follow-up to the album Guilty on which the musicians collaborated. The father-of-five brought in both Stephen and Ashley to be co-writers on the new project. Although, according to Billboard, Ashley's only prior songwriting experience was an amateur tune written for a girlfriend in the '90s, Barry was impressed and liked working with his sons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barry released his second solo album called In the Now in 2016. All 15 of the album’s tracks were co-written with Stephen and Ashley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The album is my opinion of life,” Barry told Billboard in 2016. "My feelings and my journey with my brothers, and without my brothers, with my parents and without my parents, and with my own family, seeing my kids have their own kids.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ashley is married to Therese Gibb, and they have a son, Lucas Gibb.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-travis-gibb-42></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Travis Gibb, 42</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barry and Linda welcomed their third son, Travis, on Jan. 10, 1981. He is a real estate agent in Miami, where he spent some time growing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis is married to Stacy Bash Gibb, and they have two children: Layla and Liam Gibb. On Instagram, the father-of-two occasionally shares snapshots from his life, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hiking the Appalachian Trail</a> and celebrating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>his kids' birthdays</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2013, Barry spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> about his new life as a grandparent after years of being a rocker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life," he said. "I've got seven grandchildren. I get to re-live watching Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.

When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jimmy Fallon</a> was a cast member on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Saturday Night Live</a>, one of his recurring sketches was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>“The Barry Gibb Talk Show,”</a> where he played a hairy-chested Barry, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Justin Timberlake</a> played his brother Robin. The sketches always ended with Barry losing his temper and yelling at guests or kicking set pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ashley told Billboard in 2016 that Barry “couldn’t watch it at first,” and wasn’t flattered by the parody. When Fallon invited Barry to appear in a sketch, his instinct was to decline, but Alexandra convinced him to participate. He donned a matching three-piece white suit to match “Barry” and “Robin” and sang the show’s theme song with Fallon and Timberlake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When we walked on the set, I could see these guys are pissing their pants, they are so excited he’s in the room,” Stephen told Billboard. “He’s oblivious. He doesn’t get it. It’s adorable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although she keeps her life out of the spotlight, she has joined her father at a few events over the years, including his investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWSlr%2BzxYygoJuaXaC2pb%2BMcWtqb2BphA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html&text=Barry%20Gibb%27s%205%20Children%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html&title=Barry%20Gibb%27s%205%20Children%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html&title=Barry%20Gibb%27s%205%20Children%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html&title=Barry%20Gibb%27s%205%20Children%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-barry-gibb-kids-8417047.html&description=Barry%20Gibb%27s%205%20Children%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./illumination-company.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Illumination (company) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-sommer-ray-we-found-love-islands-bennett-sipes-ex-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Who is Sommer Ray?
