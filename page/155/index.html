The EFL confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday night that the Shakers have been removed from League One.
Bolton, meanwhile, are no longer in danger of being expelled from the EFL after Football Ventures completed a £10m takeover.
How did Bury get into this position and what did the EFL want? Bury have been fighting against financial problems for several years, and were taken over by businessman Steve Dale last December to theoretically save them from going bust.

Moreover, they unfollowed each other on Instagram as well and stopped talking about each other. This made it seem like the beef between the two was deep.
