Alarcon interrupted: “I think we got the point.”</p><p><a href=#>Page Six</a> reported the court room erupted into laughter but the Kardashians did not seem amused.&nbsp;</p><p>Khloe, 37, stroked Kim’s hair while momager Kris Jenner shook her head at the comments.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=fans-mock-unflattering-courtroom-sketches>Fans mock 'unflattering' courtroom sketches</h2><p>Chyna’s lawyer also asked would-be jurors if they had a problem with stripping or&nbsp;exotic dancing due to her past.&nbsp;</p><p>None of the jurors raised their hands but some expressed a lack of enthusiasm about reality TV when asked.</p><p>One potential juror told how she had banned her daughter from watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians.&nbsp;</p><p>But for fans, the biggest outrage from jury selection was the court artist Mona Shafer Edward's sketches of the Kardashians.</p><p>One fan tweeted: "Kim is going to sue the hell out of this court room sketch artist."</p><p>Another joked that the sketch artist "must be Team Chyna".</p><h2 id=revenge-porn-storm>'Revenge porn' storm</h2><p>Blac Chyna started dating Rob in 2016 and she soon gave birth to their daughter Dream, now five.&nbsp;</p><p>Together they landed a Ryan Seacrest-produced show on E!, entitled Rob & Chyna.</p><p>The show was renewed for a second season but <a href=#>filming was put on hold</a> after the couple split in 2017.</p><p>Following the break-up, Rob posted naked pictures of Chyna on his Instagram, prompting her to file for a restraining order against the Kardashian.</p><p>A separate revenge porn case against Rob will go to court on May 2.</p><p>The Kardashians deny any wrongdoing.</p><h2 id=chyna-broke-gingerbread-houses-after-cheating-row>Chyna broke gingerbread houses after cheating row</h2><p>Chyna also alleges Rob and Kylie tried to file their own lawsuit against her claiming she beat her ex, but this case was dismissed in February.</p><p>Three months after Rob's restraining order, Chyna filed her suit claiming the Kardashians conspired to have the show cancelled.</p><p>Her lawyer stated the argument stems from a fight at Kylie Jenner's house in December 2016.</p><p>Ciani admitted that Chyna broke a TV, two gingerbread houses and a door after Rob went through her phone and accused her of cheating.</p><p>But the lawyer said unaired footage will prove she did not beat Rob with a six-foot metal pole, as the Kardashians allege in court papers filed in 2020.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Vulture</a>, the document read: “During an alcohol and drug fueled rampage, Chyna violently attacked Rob, strangled Rob with an iPhone charging cord, repeatedly struck him with her fists and a metal rod and threw a chair at Rob’s car as he drove off to escape her attack."</p><p>Leaked emails from Kylie Jenner were submitted in as evidence in the case where she brands Chyna "toxic".</p><p>Kylie's email reads, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a>: “The public has been exposed to what fake a relationship they have and it's embarrassing and makes us all look fake.</p><p>"The show is giving this toxic woman money and exposure she lives and breathes for."</p><p>She added: "Her association is detrimental to our family and Keeping Up With the Kardashians."</p><h2 id=kris-was-ringleader-in-cancelling-show>'Kris was ringleader in cancelling show'</h2><p>Last Friday it was revealed in a pre-trial hearing the Kardashians had tried to settle with Chyna out of court, according to <a href=#>CBS</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ciani said in <a href=#>a statement</a>: “Although Kris Jenner was the ringleader, her three daughters all played a role in getting Chyna's show cancelled, to their immense financial benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>“And they knew they did not have the legal right to cancel Chyna's show: all four defendants carried out their illegal activity in secret and repeatedly lied to Chyna's face.</p><p>“The ruse was so elaborate and conniving that they even instructed the Bunim Murray film crew not to have Chyna in any shots, while they told Chyna she was still filming for Season 2 of 'Rob & Chyna' and for 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'.</p><p>“Chyna went from being the star on E!'s No.1 hit show at $92,500 per episode, to being off the airwaves entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>“The defendants' illegal conduct not only cost Chyna millions and millions of dollars, their conduct was emotionally devastating to her.</p><p>“Kris Jenner was like a second mother to Chyna and Kim had been her BFF for years.&nbsp;</p><p>“The extreme betrayal and humiliation felt by Chyna, after discovering the truth about what the defendants did to her, lingers to this day.</p><p>“Chyna will appear in court to testify and to personally witness the entire trial, from start to finish.”</p><p>The Kardashians denied any wrongdoing and said in court filings that they had legitimate concerns about Rob’s safety while in a relationship with Chyna.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>Their lawyer Michael Rhodes told how he intended to bring 540 pieces of evidence to court.&nbsp;</p><p>This will include unaired footage from Rob & Chyna, as well as Keeping Up With The Kardashians footage and texts and social media posts.&nbsp;</p><img
