McMillan and Welsh were close to Richardson. This was done to get at him.</p><p>“Baigrie and Richardson have been rivals in the Edinburgh area for years. They did time together and had to be separated.</p><p>“They both want to be top dog and take no s*** from anyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651724891-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/e476999e-4e90-45f4-9b86-b7bd299887db.jpg><p>The source added: “Richardson is aligned with the Daniels in Glasgow and Baigrie is associated with their rivals the Lyons family.”</p><p>Bradley is understood to have been taken out purely because of his friendship with Richardson.</p><p>It is believed “back-up” from Glasgow was drafted in as tensions rose in the city two years ago.</p><p>Another insider said: “In the past Baigrie told Welsh what he thought of Richardson and that he shouldn’t have anything to do with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651729293-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000483753958-1.jpg><p>“Welsh just dismissed him but it sowed the seed of bother between them.</p><p>“He would help Richardson by basically acting as a fixer and speaking to folk on his behalf. He never dealt drugs though.</p><p>“When Richardson was jailed again, Baigrie was just getting out. He saw it as an opportunity to take over the streets.”</p><p>Sources claimed the hit on Welsh — shot at 8pm on April 17, 2019 as he returned home from his Holyrood Boxing Gym in Edinburgh — was finally ordered after a conversation between the T2 star and Baigrie.</p><p>One said: “Welsh told Baigrie he had stepped over the line, which he did not take kindly to.</p><p>“Baigrie thought Welsh had no right telling him anything — he took it as a personal insult. Orman was set up to take him out.”</p><p>Former amateur boxing champion Baigrie was previously caged for 15 years over an unprovoked samurai sword attack which inflicted horrific injuries on two men in Dalkeith, Midlothian, in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/08/DD-COMPOSITE-SCOTTISH-SUN-BANNER-2.jpg><p>Cocaine kingpin Richardson was jailed for his role in a crime gang that authorities said terrorised Scotland for four years. He got eight years and nine months after admitting having a Glock gun.</p><p>The hood was caged for another 18 months for reckless conduct over a cop car chase through Edinburgh in 2016. Baigrie faced no charges over Bradley’s murder, but was frequently mentioned during Orman’s 12-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.</p><p>CCTV images of a man making a call from an Airdrie phone box days after the killing were shown to the jury, and Detective Constable John Irving identified the man as Baigrie.</p><p>Prosecutor Richard Goddard said he called Orman’s mum Shona, 58, days after Bradley was murdered to tell her that her son was “okay”.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>The advocate depute also told the trial how witness Dean White, 49, claimed Orman had spoken of doing jobs for a man called ‘Dode Baigrie’.</p><p>Jurors also heard from businessman Mr McMillan about how he had known Bradley since childhood.</p><p>He described Welsh, a charity worker in the last years of his life, as a “very, very close family friend”.</p><p>Texts from Bradley read out in court called Mr McMillan his “brother”.</p><p>Details were also revealed about how Mr McMillan dropped off his dad, also called David, to visit “family friend” Richardson.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>douglas.walker@the-sun.co.uk</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Cops launch murder probe after man dies in horror Paisley house fire</span><br><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
