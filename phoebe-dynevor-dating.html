She brushed off co-star dating rumors, but might have someone else in the cards. Learn more here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The Shondaland sexy period drama <a href=#>Bridgerton</a> is one of the most-watched shows on Netflix. In addition to the Gossip Girl–esque similarities, the gorgeous wardrobe, and the diverse casting, fans couldn't get enough of the show's leads, <a href=#>Phoebe Dynevor</a> and <a href=#>Regé-Jean Page</a>, who play love interests Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset.</p><p>Viewers loved seeing the on-screen chemistry between the titular characters, and many wondered if the actors were dating in real life. But as with so many rising stars, Phoebe's name has also made headlines in connection to other romantic rumors as well.</p><p>So what's the truth? Keep reading to find out what we know about Phoebe's dating life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans believe that Phoebe Dynevor and Jaden Smith may be dating.</h2><p>Possible relationship alert! Word on the street — in particular, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> — is that the Bridgerton star has been spending some time with actor and musician <a href=#>Jaden Smith</a>. The outlet reports that Phoebe and Jaden were both spotted leaving a Louis Vuitton bash at Nobu Malibu on Friday, Nov. 19, 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Even though there is no telling what the nature of their relationship is at this time, fans believe that Phoebe and Jaden may be quietly exploring a coupledom. After all, this wouldn't be the first time celebrities have been spotted hanging out before later coming out as a couple.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Phoebe Dynevor and Pete Davidson were once an item.</h2><p>In March 2021, reports that <a href=#>Phoebe was secretly dating Pete Davidson</a> started making headlines. The two were spending a lot of time together, according to Page Six.</p><p>Phoebe reportedly visited New York (where Pete lives) in February 2021, for starters, according to Page Six. She even shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">images via Instagram</a> of her trip alongside the caption, “Grateful I got to be here for a hot sec,” with a heart emoji.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Likewise, a fan reportedly took a photo of Pete in Altrincham, Greater Manchester — where Phoebe reportedly lives with her mother — and the shared it on Facebook with the caption, “Bizarre Altrincham spot of the day … he’s staying over in Altrincham with friends.”</p><p>On July 3, 2021, the pair were officially spotted out together, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> had the photos to prove it! Phoebe and Pete looked extremely cozy at Wimbledon, enjoying the tennis and spending time together. They even matched ensembles, both wearing shades of green to the event.</p><p>However, their romance came to a screeching halt in August 2021. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, it appears that busy schedules and distance got in the way of the relationship going the distance.</p><p>“Their mates think they make a great couple, but the distance has made it completely unworkable," sources told the outlet. "They had fun and will remain close, but unless something drastic changes, their relationship won’t recover. It was wild while it lasted, and they both really care for each other, but the distance has put a strain on them.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Phoebe Dynevor ever date her 'Bridgerton' co-star?</h2><p>It's not uncommon for co-stars to develop real-life romances after working together on a project. With steamy scenes and a passionate romance between Daphne and the Duke of Hastings, Bridgerton fans wondered if Phoebe and Regé-Jean were dating IRL.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access</a> in January 2021, the actors played coy when asked about an off-screen romance. "I think everything you need to know is on camera. That's why we presented it so beautifully for you," Regé-Jean said. "All the sparks that flew off of the beautiful scripts that we were handed, and so I think that the sparky scripted material is more than enough."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Additionally, Phoebe credited the actors' on-screen chemistry to rehearsing for weeks. "We did a lot of rehearsing. I think the thing that actually really helped the chemistry was all the dance rehearsals, because we just spent so much time with our choreographer ... And we just got time to play and sort of form a connection. I think that was so beneficial actually in getting the chemistry right," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a> in January 2021.</p><p>The British star continued, "And then, we have an intimacy coordinator ... So, we blocked and rehearsed all the intimacy scenes weeks and weeks before we started to do things. By the time we got to set, we knew what we were doing. We felt really comfortable. We knew each other, we'd already formed that relationship. We were very lucky to have all that time."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who else has 'Bridgerton' star Phoebe Dynevor dated?</h2><p>The actress was previously linked to actor Sean Teale. The two were pictured together at the premiere of Snatch in Los Angeles in 2017. That same year, Sean shared several pictures of the pair on social media. However, it seems the couple split the following year as Sean posted pictures with new girlfriend, Jelly Gould.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Before Sean, Phoebe was reportedly dating recruitment executive Simon Merrill, whom she met in 2013 (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebs In-Depth</a>).</p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>, the Netflix star told the outlet that the couple traveled to Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. "It was amazing. He’s half Thai,” she said. “And we went to his family’s village. His grandma, aunt and uncle are still there, and it was a really incredible experience.”</p><p>Even though Phoebe's current relationship status is unknown, fans belive that it's only a matter of time before confirmation of a new relationship comes to light. Will it be Jaden or another Hollywood star? Only time will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWwscGeZJ2xnprDsL6MnZitoZ6c</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html&text=Fans%20Believe%20%27Bridgerton%27%20Star%20Phoebe%20Dynevor%20May%20Be%20Dating%20Someone%20New&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html&title=Fans%20Believe%20%27Bridgerton%27%20Star%20Phoebe%20Dynevor%20May%20Be%20Dating%20Someone%20New" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html&title=Fans%20Believe%20%27Bridgerton%27%20Star%20Phoebe%20Dynevor%20May%20Be%20Dating%20Someone%20New" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html&title=Fans%20Believe%20%27Bridgerton%27%20Star%20Phoebe%20Dynevor%20May%20Be%20Dating%20Someone%20New" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphoebe-dynevor-dating.html&description=Fans%20Believe%20%27Bridgerton%27%20Star%20Phoebe%20Dynevor%20May%20Be%20Dating%20Someone%20New" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paige-macdonald-y8u9-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paige MacDonald (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pat-sajak-wife-4813203.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything To Know About Lesly Brown &amp;amp; His 1st Wife  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
